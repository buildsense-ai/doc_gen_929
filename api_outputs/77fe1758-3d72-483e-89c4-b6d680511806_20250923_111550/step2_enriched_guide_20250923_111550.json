              "content": "Abstract Objectives Sleep is a fundamental element in the growth and development of adolescents. Sleep undergoes significant changes during adolescence due to physiological and environmental factors. It has been scientifically shown that the required sleep duration in adolescence is more than 8 hours per day. The aim of this study is to understand sleep patterns and sleep-wake cycle of Sharjah adolescents, and identify lifestyle habits affecting those sleep patterns, and to assess the prevalence of sleep problems. Methods The study was a cross-sectional survey of 519 high-school students, ages 14–21 years, in Sharjah city, United Arab Emirates. It was conducted using a self-filled questionnaire that included questions about demographic data, sleep and lifestyle habits and sleep problems of adolescents. Results The mean age of our sample was 16.24. Most students (64.5%) were reported to sleep between 5 and 8 hours on school nights. The average time to go to bed on weekdays was 11:25 PM. The average time to wake up on weekdays was 6:12 AM. Frequent arousals with difficulty getting back to sleep was the most encountered sleep problem among our sample. Conclusion A large proportion of adolescents in our study had insufficient sleep duration and suffer from some sleep disturbances. Smoking was found to be associated with sleep as non-smokers obtained longer sleep durations. There was no association between physical activity or usage of electrical devices and sleep. Therefore, it is necessary to intervene by organizing awareness programs to improve sleep patterns among adolescent students. Keywords: adolescents, sleep, sleep-wake patterns, United Arab Emirates 1. Introduction Sleep plays an essential role in our health; boosting the immune system, decreasing the caloric intake and improving cognition [1]. Sleep undergoes significant changes during adolescence because of both physiological and environmental factors. Physiologic factors include adolescents requiring shorter periods of sleep, increased tolerance towards sleep deprivation and adolescents having a delayed sleep and waking times due to a normal delayed circadian rhythm. This occurs as a result of a later release of melatonin; a hormone released by the body in the evening to prepare for sleep [2]. Duration and quality of sleep are fundamental factors for the growth and development of adolescents. Carskadon et al. studied the sleep patterns and their effect on the physiologic development of 458 adolescents. The study showed late bedtime associated with higher pubertal development (p < 0.02) [3]. Environmental factors affecting sleep include increased work load, emotional turmoil, extracurricular activities, and decreased influence of parents on bedtimes and lifestyle habits [2]. In a review of 67 studies, Lauren Hale et al. found that use of electronic devices before sleep especially causes an alerting effect leading to sleep disturbances among humans [4]. Brett A Dolezal and his colleagues studied 34 researches and found in 29 of them, that physical activity improve both sleep quality and quantity and can be used as an effective intervention for those having sleep problems [5]. Other lifestyle habits affecting sleep is cigarette smoking. It leads to sleep problems like having difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining asleep [6]. Research on sleep patterns among adolescents has been extensive in the western countries. A meta-analysis of 41 worldwide studies showed that sleep disturbances are a common concern among adolescents around the world. Also it showed that Asian adolescents had shorter sleep duration in weekdays compared to Northern American and European adolescents [7]. There have been limited numbers of studies done in the Middle East. A study in Saudi Arabia showed that students were having shorter sleep durations and decreased sleep quality [8]. We hypothesize that secondary school students are getting insufficient sleep duration and that lifestyle habits like (physical activity, smoking and using of electrical device before sleep) can affect sleep duration. More specifically, we hypothesize that there is a difference in sleep duration and sleep patterns between males and females. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published data concerning sleep patterns among adolescents in the United Arab Emirates. In this study, we aim to: investigate the sleeping patterns and sleep-wake cycle of Sharjah adolescents, assess the prevalence of sleep problems, and identify factors affecting sleep patterns. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design This cross-sectional study was performed in Sharjah, one of the largest cities in the United Arab Emirates. The required sample size was calculated based on this formula [9]: Where (n) is the sample size, (Z) is the Z statistic for a level of confidence which in case of 95% is equal to 1.96, (P) is the expected prevalence of a sleep duration that is less than the required and (d). Since there are no data on the sleep wake cycle of secondary school students in the United Arab Emirates, we assumed the prevalence to be 50%. With (P)—50% and (d)—5%, our sample size was 384. To decrease the margin of error and to consider the non-responders we increased the sample size to 591 students. To select our sample, we used multistage random sampling. First, we selected a stratified random sample of government schools. The stratification was based on gender, in which we chose 3 schools for girls and 3 schools for boys randomly from a list of secondary schools obtained from the Ministry of Education website. Second, we randomly selected one classroom from each grade (10th, 11th, 12th) in which all the students in the selected class were asked to participate in the study, constituting our sampling unit. 2.2. Questionnaire and data collection Our questionnaire was adopted and modified from previous studies [8],[10]. The questionnaire, consisted of 4 sections: i) demographic data; ii) sleep patterns of adolescents; iii) sleep problems including (difficulty falling asleep, frequent arousals with difficulty getting back to sleep, early morning awakenings with inability to fall back to sleep again and non-restoring sleep) all of those problems are used to assess for insomnia [7]; iv) lifestyle habits including physical activity, smoking and use of electrical devices (TV, computer, tablet, or mobile phones) before sleep. Participants were considered physically active if they performed moderate to vigorous exercises at least 60 minutes for 7 days per week based on WHO guidelines [11]. The questionnaire was written in English and then was translated into Arabic. Then the Arabic questionnaire was administered. Data collection was carried out from February to March 2017. The questionnaires were paper based and were distributed to the participants in their classes by researchers who explained the purpose of the questionnaire and clarified any queries. The researchers were students from the college of medicine and were familiar with the study protocol and were given a training on how to distribute the questionnaires and how to handle any arising questions. An ample time was given for each class to solve the questionnaires. Anonymity and confidentiality of all the participants were guaranteed and maintained. In order to estimate the average time required to complete the questionnaire and to ensure there are no difficult vocabularies in the questionnaire, a pilot study was conducted. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sharjah (REC-16-12-18-01-S). Approval for the study was also obtained from the Ministry of Education through an official letter from the Community Based Research Unit at University of Sharjah that explained the purpose of the study. Since the study participants were under the legal age for consent involved in research and parents/guardian consent was not feasible directly, the consent was sought through the Ministry of Education who contacted the schools principles for approval to administer the questionnaires. 2.3. Data analysis The data generated were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 23). Frequencies and percentages were used to analyze the data generated from each section. Chi square test was used for testing relationships between various variables including age, gender, grade, and life style habits with sleep duration and sleep problems. The statistical tests level of significance was set at p = 0.05. 3. Results 3.1. Demographics and lifestyle habits of the study population Out of 591 distributed questionnaires, 519 had complete data. Table 1 shows the demographics of the study population. There were 318 (61.3%) females and 201 (38.7%) males. The mean age was 16.24 ± 1.13 with a range of (14–21). When grouped according to grade levels, 185 (35.6%) of participants were 10th grade, 132 (25.4%) were 11th grade and 202 (38.9%) were 12th grade. Table 1. Demographics of the study population. Table 2 shows the relationship between gender and lifestyle habits. A significant difference was observed between gender and physical activity (p < 0.001), where (3.9%) of females were physically active, while (6.6%) of males were active. As for smoking, more males were found to be smokers than females (p = 0.004). Table 2. Relationship between gender and lifestyle habits. 3.2. Sleep duration and time and its relation with lifestyle habits Sleep duration on school days was grouped to 3 groups (less than 5 hours, between 5 and 8 hours, more than 8 hours). About two third of participants (64.5%) have reported sleep duration between 5 and 8 hours during school days. Females and males had similar sleep duration. There was no significant relationship between age and sleep duration (p = 0.582). With regard to sleep duration and lifestyle habits, there was a relationship between smoking and sleep durations (p = 0.011), where non-smokers obtained longer sleep durations. There was no significant relationship between age and smoking (p = 0.465). On the other hand, there was no significant relationship between being physically active and having longer sleep duration (p = 0.194). Moreover, using electrical devices before sleep was found to have no relationship to sleep duration. Table 3 shows the relationship between sleep duration and lifestyle habits. Table 3. Relationship between sleep duration and lifestyle habits (n = 519). The average time to go to bed during school days was at 11:25 PM; 122 (23.5%) of the participants reported going to sleep at 10:00 PM or earlier while 258 (49.8%) reported going to sleep between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM. There was a significant relationship between sleep time and age, as older students tended to go to bed later during the night (p = 0.005). With regard to gender, females were found to have later sleeping times compared to males (p = 0.007).The average reported wake up time during school days was at 6:12 AM with 296 (57.1%) of participants reporting waking up between 6:00 AM and 6:30 AM. There was no significant difference in waking time between females and males. As shown in Figure 1, frequent arousals with difficulty getting back to sleep, was the most encountered sleep problem among the participants reported by 156 students (30.1%). There was significant increasing with higher grades (p = 0.010). Sleep quality score was calculated by giving each sleep problem a point then adding the points for each participant. A sleep quality score of zero indicated no sleep problems and a score of four indicated the most disturbed sleep. Results showed that 27% of the participants did not report sleep problems while 43.4% of students reported having one of those sleeping problem, 10.4% reported having two of those sleeping problems and only 0.2% reported having all those four sleep problems. There was a significant difference between gender and sleep quality (p = 0.001), where females had more disturbed sleep than males. On the hand, there was no significant difference in sleep quality among smokers/nonsmokers (p = 0.438) nor users/non users of electronic devices before sleep (p = 0.872). 4. Discussion The study provides the first reported information about sleep patterns and sleep problems and their relation to lifestyle habits among secondary school students in the city of Sharjah. The study revealed that 64.5% of participants sleep between 5 to 8 hours and 20.0% of them sleep less than 5 hours. This result is less than the sleep duration recommended by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in their report “Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation” that recommends 9 hours of sleep per night for adolescents [12]. The presented sleep duration in the study is similar to that of other studies in western countries like United State of America USA [13] as well as Asian countries like Saudi Arabia [14], Lebanon [15], and Korea [16] which indicates that it is a global issue that need to be addressed. Continuous insufficient sleep duration during school nights will actually lead to “sleep debt”, as adolescents tend to sleep later during weekends to compensate the insufficient sleep [17]. In fact there are many reasons to be concerned about the sleep habits of the majority of these adolescents. Short sleep duration is known to be linked to altered cardio metabolic markers and impaired insulin resistance [18], and those with shorter sleep durations have a 1.15 times greater risk of developing a stroke and 1.48 times more likely to have heart diseases than the general population [19]. Additionally in a meta-analysis of 17 studies, insufficient sleep duration was associated with poor school performance [20]. There are several factors affecting adolescent sleep like participation in extracurricular activities according to Short et al. as he found that increased hours spent on these activities will be associated with less sleep duration in Australian and United States adolescents [21]. Another important factor affecting sleep adolescents is family. A positive family and home environment without chaos or conflict will be associated with healthy behaviors like sufficient sleep [22]. Moreover, socioeconomic status related matters like family income and shared sleeping spaces can also impact adolescents' sleep [23]. In our study, sleep duration was not significantly associated with age or grade. The finding is not consistent with a study done by John in 2015 this previous study [10]. However, this finding is consistent with Yang et al. [16] as it is stated that the transition point for changes in sleep duration occurs in the 10th grade as all higher grades (10th, 11th, and 12th) have the same academic demand and our study included those three grades only. We noted no significant relationship in sleep duration between males and females, and this is similar to other studies done in Germany [24], Nigeria [25], and Saudi Arabia [14]. Nonetheless, Roenneberg et al. reported females having longer total sleep time compared to males [26]. These variations can be attributed to the differences in the age group of participants in these studies, health-related variables and the measurement of sleep time. On average, students' bedtime was 11:25 PM, and is this not far from that reported for adolescents of similar age in other studies done in Iceland, Hong Kong, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Korea [7]. We found that females had later sleeping times compared to males; this was somewhat unexpected and contrasted with results from many previous studies [8],[27] High schools in United Arab Emirates start at around 08:00, mandating adolescents to wake up early thus the average waking up time was 6:12 PM. Waking up timings were the same for both females and males due to similar school start times. It was found that an earlier school start time is a key modifiable factor for circadian rhythm disruption and insufficient sleep in adolescents. Delaying school start timings is considered an effective method for chronic sleep loss in substantial number of studies [28] Regarding lifestyle habits and its effect on sleep duration, smoking was found to affect sleep duration while physical activity did not. McKnight-Eily L studied the relationship between duration of sleep and health-risk behaviors in 12,154 U.S. adolescents and found a significant relation between cigarette smoking and reduced sleep durations [29], which is consistent with our study. The present study showed no relation between physical activity and sleep duration. Studies regarding this relationship have inconsistent findings as some found no relationship and some found being physically active increases sleep duration while others found an inverse relationship [14]. This variation can be because of differences in the definition of being physically active as some studies define it as being active for ≥60 minutes in ≥5 days of the week whereas other studies define it as being physically active for ≥60 minutes in 7 days of the week. Concerning sleep problems, frequent arousals with difficulty getting back to sleep was the most encountered sleep problem among our sample and higher grades had a higher prevalence of this problem. A significant relation was found between gender and sleep quality, where females had more disturbed sleep than males. Similarly, another study that was done in Saudi Arabia has reported sleep disturbances being significantly more frequent among females than males [8]. However one study that was done in Lebanon has reported no significant difference between males and females sleep quality and attributed this to a broader cultural diversity among the participants [30]. Another common problem our sample faced is difficulty in falling asleep. This is keeping with the work of Lazaratou et al. who studied sleep problems among 713 Greek adolescents and found delayed sleep onset and insufficient duration of sleep as the main complains these adolescents have [31]. In our study, 78.8% of the participants used electrical devices before sleep, with no differences in regard to gender. Also electrical devices usage before sleep didn't affect sleep duration nor sleep quality. This is inconsistent with a study that was done on adolescents (ages 12–18 years), in which those who reported having more than 8 hours of sleep per day were found to be less engaged in technology-related activities after 9 pm in comparison to those who slept less than 8 hours [32]. Another study hypothesized that chronic exposure to electrical lighting in the late evening can disrupts melatonin and can lead to sleep disturbances since melatonin levels are highly sensitive to room light levels [33]. 5. Conclusion and recommendations The study investigated sleep patterns and problems and its relationship to lifestyle habits among adolescent school students in Sharjah city, United Arab Emirates. The results revealed that the majority of adolescents are sleeping less than the recommended sleep duration and have sleep problems. This calls for awareness programs targeting adolescents, parents and schools staff to teach them about the importance of sleep and provide good sleep hygiene strategies. There should be further surveillance studies using validated questionnaires to assess sleep health and factors affecting sleep among adolescents.

Firstly, it was a cross sectional study thus the temporal relationship concerning the predictors and outcomes is not clear. Second, our sample included only governmental school going adolescents, hence these findings can't be generalized. With that being said, governmental schools are considered representative of a large part of secondary school students because of their high number in Sharjah. And since this is considered to the best of our knowledge the first study to assess sleep patterns among adolescents, we only chose to include governmental schools students and we believe this will pave the way to more research regarding this topic especially after considering our study findings. Third, the questionnaire used was not a validated one and did not include all factors affecting sleep like the duration of electrical devices usage before sleep. Nevertheless, despite those limitations, the findings of this study offer a baseline data for upcoming research. Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.

              "content": "Abstract New sleep deprivation studies confirm the relationship between inadequate sleep and a wide range of disorders, such as hypertension, obesity and type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, impaired immune functioning, and more. In the inaugural issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005), a feature article1 traced early milestones in the developing field of sleep medicine, which slowly emerged from the older field of sleep research during the 1970s and 1980s. Sleep medicine, the article noted, was closely linked with and made possible by the discovery of electrical activity in the brain. The examination of electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns that occur during sleep led to the classification of stages of sleep, which in turn created an important foundation for probing human sleep, discerning abnormalities, and discovering significant relationships between sleep and health. By 2005, scientists and clinicians had not only identified and clearly defined a large number of sleep disorders but had discovered that many of them were highly prevalent. The pace of research and discovery has only accelerated since 2005, and the number of peer-reviewed sleep journals has more than tripled. Today, researchers are more deeply probing the cellular and subcellular effects of disrupted sleep, as well as the effects of sleep deprivation on metabolism, hormone regulation, and gene expression. Newer studies are strengthening known and suspected relationships between inadequate sleep and a wide range of disorders, including hypertension,2 obesity and type-2 diabetes,3 impaired immune functioning,4 cardiovascular disease and arrhythmias,5,6 mood disorders,7 neurodegeneration and dementia, 8,9 and even loneliness.10 Research findings continue to underscore early concerns about public safety that were first raised when major industrial disasters such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill were linked to inadequate sleep.11 Related research sponsored by major organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has helped to inspire national initiatives aimed at improving public safety and health. However, despite the astounding acceleration in research during the past few decades, inadequate sleep due to sleep disorders, work schedules, and chaotic lifestyles continues to threaten both health and safety. “Pushing against the wave of accelerated growth in the field has been a shoreline of indifference,” says David F. Dinges, PhD, Professor and Chief of the Division of Sleep and Chronobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. “Modern industrial pressures to use time 24 hours a day have led to shiftwork and a world in which virtually everything—law Susan L. Worley is a freelance medical writer who resides in Pennsylvania. enforcement, airports and all kinds of transportation, industrial operations, and hospitals—operates 24/7. People have come to value time so much that sleep is often regarded as an annoying interference, a wasteful state that you enter into when you do not have enough willpower to work harder and longer.” It has become increasingly clear, however, that no matter how hectic our lives may be, we can no longer afford to ignore what research is telling us about the importance of sleep for our safety and mental and physical well-being. Impact on Attention, Cognition, and Mood While scientists are still working to identify and clarify all of the functions of sleep,12 decades of studies—many of which have used the method of disrupting sleep and examining the consequences—have confirmed that sleep is necessary for our healthy functioning and even survival. “We know for sure that sleep serves multiple functions,” says Dr. Dinges. “Nature tends to be very parsimonious in that it often uses a single system or biology in multiple ways to optimize the functioning of an organism. We know, for example, that sleep is critical for waking cognition—that is, for the ability to think clearly, to be vigilant and alert, and sustain attention. We also know that memories are consolidated during sleep, and that sleep serves a key role in emotional regulation.” Studies conducted by Dr. Dinges and other scientists have shown that cognitive performance and vigilant attention begin to decline fairly quickly after more than 16 hours of continuous wakefulness, and that sleep deficits from partial sleep deprivation can accumulate over time, resulting in a steady deterioration in alertness. The widely used psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), a simple neurocognitive test developed by Dr. Dinges and colleagues that assesses an individual’s ability to sustain attention and respond to signals in a timely manner, has proven to be an exceptionally sensitive tool for capturing dose–response effects of sleep loss on neurobehavioral functioning. 13 The PVT also reliably detects sleep deficits caused by disrupted or fragmented sleep, and/or poorly timed sleep, which is important because a growing body of evidence suggests that the continuity and timing (or circadian alignment) of sleep may be as important as the total amount of time spent sleeping. “We know that sleep is much more restorative of waking functions and health when it is consolidated and not fragmented,” explains Dr. Dinges. “That is, when sleep goes through the appropriate physiological sequences of non-REM (rapid eye movement) and REM states at night, and occurs when human sleep is temporally programmed by our circadian clock to occur. Such consolidated sleep is typically of a longer duration and better sleep quality than sleep taken at other times of the day, such as that which occurs with nightshift work, jet lag, and other conditions of circadian misalignment.” Dr. Dinges and his colleagues have found that people whose daily sleep duration is inadequate, or repeatedly disrupted (e.g., by obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, pain or stress, or shiftwork or jet lag), often are not aware of their accumulating sleep deficits or the toll that these deficits can take on their waking cognitive functions, including their performance, working memory, cognitive speed, and accuracy. Inadequate sleep also can take a toll on psychological well-being, significantly affecting our emotional and psychosocial interpretation of events and exacerbating our stress levels. Studies have indicated that changes in mood may be due in part to the effects of sleep deprivation on the processing of emotional memory—in other words, our tendency to select and remember negative memories after inadequate sleep.14 In one study conducted by Dr. Dinges and colleagues, participants’ mood was observed after they were confronted with “high” and “low” performance demands, following varying degrees of sleep deprivation.15 “To our surprise, those who were sleep-deprived responded to low stressors in much the same way that people without any sleep deprivation tended to respond to high stressors,” said Dr. Dinges. “In other words, we tend to become much more sensitive emotionally and socially when we are sleep-deprived. That is what I like to call the ‘who was at my desk or who touched my coffee cup?’ phenomenon. I think we all have experienced having an extreme reaction or a very negative emotional response to a mild stressor when we have not had enough sleep.” Aiming for the Sweet Spot How much sleep is enough? After decades of investigation, it appears that scientists have gathered enough evidence to begin to answer that question.16 “When duration of sleep drops below seven hours, and especially when it starts to move toward six and half hours or less, a number of different disorders begin to increase in prevalence,” says Dr. Dinges. “Most experts would agree that there is a kind of sweet spot that most people should aim for, and for the average healthy adult that zone is ideally somewhere between 7 and 7 and a half hours. That is what the consensus evaluations of more than a thousand scientific articles have yielded—the consensus of evaluations conducted by the AASM (American Academy of Sleep Medicine) and Sleep Research Society jointly.” Numerous large U.S. surveys—beginning with a 1982 survey by the American Cancer Society—have been used to estimate the number of hours that most people spend sleeping. Many surveys have identified a worrisome prevalence of “short” sleepers (people who sleep 6 hours or less) among respondents, and a general trend toward decreasing sleep duration between 1975 and 2006. More recently, however, an analysis of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), spearheaded by Mathias Basner, MD, PhD, at the University of Pennsylvania17, has suggested that there may be cause for optimism. “The analysis shows that there is a slight but steady increase in sleep time that stretches back to about 2003 or 2004,” says Dr. Dinges. “We think this increase, which is modest—at most a minute or two more per year—is due in part to the development of the field of sleep medicine, and public and scientific reports in the media about sleep loss contributing to accidents and catastrophes, and so forth. Ever so slowly, the message that it is important not to get sleep deprived, and to get help if you have a sleep disorder, has begun to penetrate to the public.” The analysis notes that one sign of greater interest in sleep on the part of the public has been a significant increase in Google searches containing the word “sleep” since 2004. Data from the ATUS also suggest that over time, people have been willing to trade some of their daily activities in exchange for more sleep. It is important to note, says Dr. Dinges, that self-reports of time spent sleeping are not always accurate—they can be off by a half an hour or more, usually with people tending to estimate that they slept more than they did. He also notes that there is still a fairly large population sleeping 6 hours or less. “Although there are signs that sleep time is increasing, it is not happening at nearly the dramatic rate that most experts would like to see,” says Dr. Dinges. “This is especially true for vulnerable populations. There is concern about school start times and bus times affecting the sleep of children and adolescents, and about extracurricular activities at the end of the school day sometimes leading to a delay in bed times for teenagers. All of this is an ongoing, evolving picture, with more research results coming out all the time, and with consequent changes in recommendations, to make sure that at least our most vulnerable populations are getting adequate sleep.” Interindividual Differences in Vulnerability to Sleep Loss While it is well established that the effects of sleep loss accumulate over time, with repeated exposure to inadequate, fragmented, or disrupted sleep, the degree to which individuals demonstrate adverse effects of inadequate sleep can vary considerably.18 “We have learned that there are astonishingly mysterious phenotypes, or trait-like differences, in how vulnerable people are to sleep loss,” says Dr. Dinges. “This is still a relatively new area of research, and it has only been in the past few years that scientists have begun to replicate early findings regarding these phenotypic differences in vulnerability to the negative neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss. The interindividual differences that have been observed so far raise some extremely provocative scientific questions. We may find that there is something in waking biology that can substitute for, or somehow reduce, the impact of sleep loss on waking functioning, but thus far there is no evidence as to what that might be.” Differences among individuals exist with regard to both the effects of sleep loss and the ability to recover from the effects of sleep loss. Differences in performance also have been shown to be task-dependent, suggesting that people who are vulnerable to the effects of sleep loss in one or more cognitive or neurobehavioral domains may be resistant to the effects of sleep loss in others. To better understand interindividual variability, scientists are investigating possible genetic mechanisms that may underlie complex interactions between circadian and sleep homeostatic systems—the systems that affect our drive for sleep as well as our alertness and performance during waking hours. A current goal is to discover biomarkers that may help predict individual performance after varying degrees of sleep loss.19 And one hope is that biomarkers—ideally in the form of a simple “roadside” test such as a breathalyzer—may eventually be used to detect sleep loss-related impairment in drivers or in individuals responsible for operating sophisticated equipment or machinery. To date, no viable candidates have been found. Investigators also are shedding light on the role that age may play in resilience to sleep loss. The results of one recent study indicate that younger adults are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of chronic sleep loss and recurring circadian disruption than older adults.20 Although the neurobiological basis for these age-related differences is not yet understood, such findings may help to inform new approaches to the prevention of drowsy driving and related motor-vehicle accidents among young drivers. Dr. Dinges emphasizes that findings regarding interindividual differences in response to sleep loss and in recovery from sleep loss should not diminish the message that adequate sleep is critical for everyone. “Research has shown us that sleep is not an optional activity,” says Dr. Dinges. “There is no question that sleep is fundamentally conserved across species and across lifespans, and that any effort to eliminate it has been unsuccessful. We must plan our lives in the time domain with a serious consideration for sleep—planning when to sleep, ensuring that we get adequate sleep, and making sure that our sleep is not disturbed by disorders or diseases, whether or not they are sleep-related.” Addressing Sleep Disorders As connections between sleep disruption and both disease and mortality have become more firmly established, accurate and efficient diagnosis and management of sleep disorders (see Table 1) have become increasingly critical. Recent directions in the field of sleep medicine include a move toward patient-centered care, greater collaboration between specialists and primary care physicians, and the incorporation of new tools—including home-based diagnostic tests and novel electronic questionnaires—in the effort to create a comprehensive yet more personalized approach to assessment and treatment. Table 1. Table courtesy of Michael J. Sateia, MD A chief goal is to improve the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Although approximately 70 million people in the U.S. have at least one sleep disorder, experts estimate that up to 80% of sleep disorders may go undetected or undiagnosed. One major challenge that clinicians face during the initial assessment of people with sleep disorders is the process of identifying and sorting out comorbidities. Untangling the causes and effects in bidirectional comorbidities can be particularly difficult. For example, insomnia—by far the most common sleep disorder—often is complicated by the presence of another sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome. “Some experts have even suggested that all cases of insomnia coexist with, or are caused by, another sleep disorder, most commonly sleep apnea,” says Clete A. Kushida, MD, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, and Division Chief and Medical Director of Stanford Sleep Medicine. “I’m not sure I would go quite that far, but certainly bidirectional comorbidities among individuals who experience sleep disorders are common. For example, pain syndromes—including back pain and limb pain, especially among older patients—are common comorbidities in patients with insomnia. Mood disorders also frequently occur in patients who experience insomnia.” Comorbidities can complicate treatment and often require sleep specialists to collaborate with not only primary care physicians but also specialists in other therapeutic areas. “If, for example, a person with insomnia also has been diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist,” says Dr. Kushida, “our goal is to work hand in hand with the psychiatrist to find the right medication. There are both sedating and alerting antidepressants, and a patient may need to try one medication for a couple of weeks to months, slowly increasing the dose to a therapeutic level, until the effect on both the depression and the patient’s sleep can be determined. For some individuals, an alerting antidepressant can cause poor sleep, which in turn can exacerbate the depression. The process of achieving the right dose of the right medication can be complex, and benefits from a collaboration between specialists.” Undetected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with chronic pain, or other serious illnesses, can result in potentially dangerous comorbidities. Opioids, for example, are known to have adverse effects on respiration, and can lead to central sleep apnea (CSA)—shallow and irregular or interrupted breathing and sustained hypoventilation—a potentially lethal condition that can intensify the consequences of OSA. These risks underscore the need to improve methods for identifying and properly diagnosing the estimated 23.5 million U.S. adults with OSA. Public education and advocacy efforts are already helping to improve detection—in part by helping to address misconceptions about OSA. “One of the biggest misconceptions is that only people who are significantly overweight experience sleep apnea,” says Dr. Kushida. “In fact, only up to 67% of people who have OSA are overweight, the rest are of normal weight. OSA also can be caused by craniofacial dysmorphism, or a defect of the airway that occurs during development. A narrow airway caused by deficient growth of the craniofacial skeleton, particularly the jaws, can become narrower and more prone to collapse with age, leading to sleep apnea.” Treating Insomnia: The Value of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Insomnia, the most prevalent sleep disorder, affects approximately one third of all adults and is the most common condition that family and primary-care physicians encounter. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3), chronic insomnia is the inability to attain sufficient sleep (despite adequate opportunity) for at least three nights per week for three months or longer, with negative daytime consequences. For most people, the disorder is transient, but for approximately 10% to 15% of those who experience insomnia (around 30 million people) it becomes chronic. Although pharmacologic treatments for insomnia (Table 2) can be effective, most experts now recommend against the long-term use of pharmacotherapy. Table 2. “If a person has been diagnosed with chronic insomnia, the only treatment that has been shown to have long-term benefit is cognitive behavioral therapy, “says Dr. Kushida. “Medications really should be considered short-term treatments, because patients tend to develop dependence on, or tolerance to, hypnotic drugs. In our clinic, we commonly see that, over time, medications stop having an effect, and that means that patients may try higher doses of a medication, or keep switching to different medications. So, medications are a temporary solution—they just put a Band-Aid on the problem of insomnia, whereas cognitive behavioral therapy targets one of the pathways toward success.” Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which involves techniques that work in part by reducing cognitive and somatic arousal, is estimated to be effective in approximately 70% to 80% of people who experience chronic insomnia. Dr. Kushida notes that while drugs can sometimes be useful in the treatment of acute insomnia, they become problematic after acute insomnia transitions to chronic insomnia. “A person might be an OK sleeper for several years, and then suddenly experience a traumatic event, such as the loss of a job, a divorce, or the death of a loved one, resulting in very poor sleep,” says Dr. Kushida. “Down the road, that person might obtain a better job, overcome grief, or find a new relationship, but continue to experience insomnia. We think in some cases the transition from acute insomnia to chronic insomnia occurs because the behavioral event triggers something in the person’s physiology that may lead to long-term changes. Once they are in a chronic insomnia phase, we tell patients that CBT is the only truly effective intervention.” If a patient is already taking hypnotics, Dr. Kushida says that he will gradually wean the patient off medications while introducing CBT. He notes that often it is necessary for sleep specialists to manage the expectations of chronic sufferers. “We sometimes have to let patients with chronic insomnia know that we may never get them back to where they were when they had optimal sleep,” Dr. Kushida explains. “The behavioral methods we use work well, and usually we can get patients to the point where the insomnia is having less of an impact on their quality of life. Our inability to completely restore the patient’s ability to sleep well may partly be explained by as yet unidentified changes in his or her neurophysiology or neurochemistry. Some patients with chronic insomnia can begin to sleep normally again, but for the vast majority, we aim to make insomnia less of a burden on a patient’s daily life.” Improving Clinical Research In the field of sleep medicine, as in many other therapeutic areas, future directions in clinical trial research will place an emphasis on patient engagement and patient-centered outcomes. “Perhaps the most important aim these days when developing and implementing any type of large-scale clinical research study is to incorporate the patient’s perspective,” says Dr. Kushida, who is currently analyzing the results of a comparative effectiveness sleep study sponsored by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).22 The study, designed and conducted by a team at Stanford, introduced a new model of patient-centered, coordinated care and tested it against conventional outpatient treatment for sleep disorders. “The patient’s perspective is so invaluable in guiding the success of a study that ideally it should be incorporated right at the inception of a research question or idea,” says Dr. Kushida. “When you are designing an especially complicated trial, for example, it is easy to incorporate a lot of tests and measures without being aware of the burden these can place on the participants. It’s critical to learn from patients whether they are overwhelmed by the number of tests, or whether travel time or the amount of time they need to take off from work may be impractical.” Other efforts to improve clinical research include those focused on correcting for and/or eliminating several confounding variables that tend to plague sleep research. The surprising power of the placebo effect,23 the related disconnect between objective and subjective evaluations of sleep loss and recovery from sleep loss, variable adherence to treatments, and, more recently, deceptive practices among clinical trial participants, are a few examples. The placebo effect, which refers to any outcome that may be attributable to the expectations of clinical trial participants rather than to the drug or device being tested, can be especially problematic in experimental protocols that involve self-reports of sleep quality. “Clinical trials involving patients with disorders such as insomnia or RLS that rely solely on subjective measures, or ratings of severity based on patient report, are particularly vulnerable to the placebo effect,” says Dr. Kushida. “It has been demonstrated that when these patients believe that they are receiving the study drug or device the likelihood of their experiencing a positive effect can increase significantly. There have been efforts to develop or introduce new objective endpoints in these studies, which may help with this problem.” Achieving the right balance of subjective and objective measures of sleep is an important goal in both research and clinical practice. The current gold standard for objective assessment of sleep is polysomnography (PSG), which includes electrophysiological recordings of brain activity (EEG), muscle activity (EMG), and eye movements (EOG). A valuable, non-invasive method for determining sleep continuity and sleep architecture, PSG has been an indispensable objective endpoint in clinical trials, but it is expensive and not always practical. Novel approaches to objective measurement, including actigraphy, which may be used to help minimize recall bias and complement subjective measures of sleep (e.g., sleep logs or diaries), still have drawbacks.24 “The problem with wearable devices right now,” says Dr. Kushida, “is that they tend to overestimate sleep, sometimes by as much as an hour. They also are not yet capable of accurately detecting different stages of sleep, such as non-REM and REM sleep. Because of our proximity to Silicon Valley, our laboratory tests a lot of these new devices, and often by the time we have finished testing one prototype, new ones have emerged. The product cycles are rapid, and the companies keep incorporating newer and newer technology. So, down the road, within about five to ten years, I think these devices will likely estimate sleep and detect sleep stages with precision.” Also, objective tools are needed for addressing problems with adherence to treatment. One important current aim is to detect and correct for non-obvious factors that result in failure to adhere to treatment, whether unintended or deliberate, to ensure that trial outcomes accurately reflect the efficacy of a drug, medical device, or behavioral intervention.25 A related problem is deliberate deception by trial participants. As part of a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-supported study focused on detecting and correcting for adherence problems, Dr. Kushida and colleagues began to explore the prevalence of deceptive practices among clinical trial participants.26 “We found that deception among clinical trial participants is pretty common and that there is quite a range of deceptive practices, “says Dr. Kushida. “They include underreported drug holidays, fabrication or withholding of medical histories, pill dumping, exaggerated symptoms, and falsification of current health status. It’s important that we find a way to address these deceptive practices because both the integrity of research data and the safety of participants are at risk.” Dr. Kushida adds that newer tools, such as electronic monitoring of pill dispensing and statistical predictive adherence models, may uncover and remedy pressing problems related to adherence and deceptive practices. “It already takes about 12 years for a new drug to be approved, and about three to five years for a new device to be approved. When deceptive practices are discovered too late, it can lead to the invalidation of research findings and further delays in approving much-needed treatments.” Enhancing clinical research in the field will require a cooperative, international effort focused on advancing knowledge about sleep, circadian rhythms, and sleep disorders worldwide. During Dr. Kushida’s tenure as inaugural president of the World Sleep Society (WSS), he led an initiative to create international sleep fellowships to prepare physicians and scientists from various countries for future leadership roles in basic and/or clinical sleep research. He also oversaw the development of an International Sleep Research Network, designed to help sleep scientists and clinicians find collaborators with similar clinical/research interests. As the WSS continues to offer new services and expand its programs, it will be with an awareness of the needs of disadvantaged populations and the importance of access to appropriate treatment. “One initiative of the WSS involves reviewing current published guidelines in various countries, to determine whether they meet international standards,” says Dr. Kushida. “Many guidelines are region-specific and list only medications approved in specific countries or regions. As we review the guidelines, we endorse them with caveats; we may note that particular treatments for insomnia are recommended, and when these are not available we recommend acceptable substitutes. The goal is to ensure that specialists can use practice guidelines in whichever country they practice sleep medicine, and that patients are receiving the best possible treatment available.” REFERENCES - 1.Shepard JW, Buysse DJ, Chesson AL, et al.

              "content": "February 3rd, 2025 每一個取得非凡成就的團隊都必須首先設定目標才能實現目標。設定好目標的團隊可以實現更出色的成果，如治癒疾病、建置更高效、更永續的設備或是讓我們的海洋更適合鯨魚和海豚生存。設定目標後，我們可以看到想要實現的目標，並且全力以赴。 但實現雄心壯志並不只是達到目標，還需要一條通往終點的道路，而這就是 SMART 目標的用武之地。SMART 是一個縮寫詞，可協助您定義、設定偉大目標。藉助 SMART，您可以確保備妥實現專案目標乃至更大型的公司目標所需要的一切內容。來看看如何辦到。 SMART 是一個縮寫詞，可協助您建立妥善定義、具可否證性且可實現的目標。SMART 代表著： 明確 (Specific) 可衡量 (Measurable) 可實現 (Achievable) 切實可行 (Realistic) 有時間限制 (Time-bound) 縮寫詞 SMART 就是設定偉大目標的捷徑，因為其中包含了成功所需的一切因素。以下介紹如何分解及完成每一部分： 請記住，設定 SMART 目標是為了達到特定目的，而非泛泛而談。您不僅希望所有計劃都能成功，而且希望特定專案也能成功。若要確保能夠實現這些目標，請務必讓目標與目前手上的工作彼此相關。 SMART 中的 M 表示可衡量 (measurable)，這一點可協助您評估專案是否成功。您的目標應以某種客觀的方法來衡量，可以是截止時間、數字、百分比變化或是其他一些可衡量的元素。 雖然不應設定太容易實現的目標，但還是要確保所設定的目標是可行、能想像得到的。可實現意即目標不應完全脫離現實。可問問自己：目標是否在專案範圍內？若不是，就是不可實現的。 延伸性目標是指刻意挑戰的目標。例如，若您的網站每個月通常會有 30,000 名訪客，延伸性目標可能會設定為每月 50,000 名訪客。這是大幅度的增長！但此延伸性目標仍落在可能實現的現實範圍內。務必讓您的延伸性目標展現雄心壯志，而非不切實際，譬如，將目標定為讓訪客人數從每月 30,000 名飆漲為 300,000 名，這就不切實際了。 SMART 中的 A (可實現) 和 R (切實可行) 息息相關。除了設定可實現的目標以外，目標還需要切實可行。例如，也許目標可實現，但代價是每一位團隊成員都要超時工作六週。即使這一目標可實現，卻並非切實可行。務必透過建立清晰的資源管理計劃，同時兼顧兩者。 您的 SMART 目標應設定結束日期。若沒有時間限制，專案可能會拖延，無法得到清晰的成功指標，而且會遭遇範疇潛變的情況。若還未設定結束日期，務必要列出清晰的專案時間軸。 確保您的重要目標涵蓋 SMART 的每一個元素可能比設定一般目標更耗時，但從 SMART 目標中所得到的價值會大於設定目標過程中所額外花費的時間。目標不應設定過後就忘記，而應是專案規劃過程中的關鍵部分。透過設定 SMART 目標，您與團隊就能得到： 清晰溝通與步調一致。當您的專案團隊確切瞭解工作的目的，團隊就能更有動力、更步調一致。瞭解個人工作內容對於更大的公司目標有何作用的團隊成員，相比起其他同事，其工作動力將會加倍，因此設定、分享 SMART 目標有助於提升整個團隊的動力。 專案成功明晰度。試過在專案結束後仍不知道自己是否已經實現目標嗎？SMART 目標有助於設定清晰目標，避免目標模糊不清或讓人困惑。 清晰的藍圖與完成指標。藉助 SMART 目標，您能確切知道要實現什麼，以及何時能實現。您已經驗證過這些目標是否切實可行且可實現了，也知道可以進行衡量，以便瞭解是否已經實現。 可追蹤的指標。完成專案時，SMART 目標有助於評估專案是否成功。如果沒有實現，也不要自責。事實上，在 Asana，我們的目標是要實現 70% 的目標。這樣就會知道設定的是具有挑戰性但可能實現的目標。無論是否已經達到目標，SMART 目標都可以協助您進行評估，以便從中總結經驗。 準備好開始了嗎？撰寫 SMART 目標前，這裡提供 5 個 SMART 目標範例，介紹每一個目標要如何符合 SMART 標準。 範例：為第一季度的每一個月生產至少三種不同的大型行銷資產類型 (例如：電子書、網路研討會、影片、一至兩頁的銷售簡報)。 符合 SMART 的原因：目標明確 (大型行銷資產)，可衡量 (三種不同類型)，可實現且切實可行 (雖要以專案團隊成員數目為準，但我們可以假設每個月都有足夠人手來完成這些資產)，以及有時間限制 (第一季度中的每個月)。 範例：在 2022 財政年度上半年期間，產品團隊將合作開展五個跨職能專案，重點為可用性測試、客戶問卷調查、客戶行銷或研發。 符合 SMART 的原因：目標是明確的 (專案專注於可用性測試、客戶調查、客戶行銷或研發)，可衡量 (五個跨職能專案)，可實現 (六個月內完成五個專案)，切實可行 (專案將跨整個產品團隊進行)，有時間限制 (2022 財政年度上半年)。 範例：2021 年期間，我將透過指導培養自己的管理技能，至少有兩名學員來自於我們公司的僱員資源群組或我的校友人際網絡。 符合 SMART 的原因：目標是明確的 (透過指導增進管理技能)，可衡量 (至少兩位學員)，可實現且切實可行 (這個人有兩種尋找學員的不同途徑)，以及有時間限制 (2021 年期間)。 範例：我要訓練成可以在兩小時內跑完三月份舉行的聖地亞哥半程馬拉松。 符合 SMART 的原因：目標是明確的 (聖地亞哥半程馬拉松)，可衡量 (兩小時內)，可實現 (對於大多數經過適當訓練的賽跑人士而言，兩小時是一個既有抱負又可行的速度)，切實可行 (這個人已確定會進行訓練來備戰半程馬拉松)，以及有時間限制 (三月)。 範例：我們將在二月份為中學生提供 100 小時的數學與歷史免費輔導。 符合 SMART 的原因：目標是明確的 (為中學生進行數學與歷史輔導)，可衡量 (100 個小時)，可實現且切實可行 (取決於非營利組織的志願者數量)，以及有時間限制 (二月期間)。 準備好設定您的 SMART 目標時，先從撰寫一到兩句專案目標開始。然後，將五個 SMART 屬性逐一運用到您的目標中，並且確保涵蓋到所有基礎元素。準備開始時，可使用這些範本： 初始目標：寫下您的初始目標。如果沒有完全符合 SMART 也無需擔心，稍後我們會在範本中加以完善。 範例：我想要在社交媒體上推廣公司品牌。 讓目標更明確：目標是否確切定義您想完成的事？如否，可重新組織語言，讓它更特定於您的某個專案。 例如：在 Instagram 上使用公司特定話題標籤，推廣公司品牌。 讓目標可衡量：是否想好專案完成後如何衡量目標？如否，新增一種衡量專案結束後是否成功的方式。 例如：開發公司特定話題標籤，用以產生 1,000 個新的 Instagram 追蹤者。 讓目標可實現：您的專案範圍能夠實現這個目標嗎？需確保這一特定目標處在專案涵蓋範圍內。 例如：開發並使用公司特定話題標籤，結合產業中的流行標籤，以此產生 1,000 個新的 Instagram 追蹤者。 讓目標切實可行：專案團隊是否能夠合理地實現目標？即使是延伸性目標，也應確保您可以憑藉手上的資源完成它。 例如：每天在 Instagram 上發佈貼文，確保每一則貼文同時附帶公司特定標籤及產業流行標籤，以利產生 1,000 個新的 Instagram 追蹤者。 讓目標有時間限制：何時需要實現目標？務必在您的 SMART 目標中指明目標日期或專案時間軸。 例如：2022 財政年度上半年中的每一個工作日都在 Instagram 上發佈貼文。6 月 30 日前，確保每一則貼文同時附帶公司特定標籤及產業流行標籤，以利產生 1,000 個新的 Instagram 追蹤者。 是否在電子郵件、會議或試算表中追蹤目標？若是，您並不是唯一一個。根據 Asana 目標報告，53% 的企業會透過電子郵件追蹤其目標， 36% 會以試算表進行追蹤，而 31% 則會在面對面會議上進行追蹤。 追蹤目標的難點在於要找到一種將目標與團隊日常工作連結起來的方法。您已經花了很多時間來建立 SMART 目標，將它置於首要地位可以助您確實達成目標。在 Asana，我們認為目標應與人們進行的工作密切相關。您可以： 在專案伊始，務必將 SMART 目標呈現給每一位參與工作的人員。處理專案交付項目時，您的 SMART 目標應作為整個團隊的指南，這樣您就能夠知道專案目標是否實現了。 最好的做法就是使用像 Asana 這樣的工作管理工具。如此，團隊就能擁有可在一處地方容納所有資訊的集中事實來源，從日常工作到專案目標盡收其中。與其讓目標隱藏於文件、辦公桌或其他難以尋找的地方，不如將其與日常工作連結，讓每個人都能更有動力、更專注，且能維持資訊同步。 除了在專案開始時與團隊分享 SMART 目標以外，務必定期衡量進度是否朝目標發展。您不希望進行專案到最後卻發現錯失了目標。您努力設定明確、可衡量的目標是有原因的，因為它可以作為北極星，在必要時對專案進行適當調整。 定期檢查 SMART 目標的最佳方式是每週傳送專案狀態更新。若要醒目提示團隊所完成的重要工作、即將來臨的里程碑以及是否進展順利，狀態更新就是一種絕佳方式。 SMART 目標可讓目標設定流程清楚明晰，這樣您可以準確衡量是否已經實現專案目標。如果實現了，那就是時候慶祝一番了！即便沒有實現，擁有如此明確的目標，而且進行定期檢查，也能幫助您很好地確定出問題所在，以及下次可改善的地方。 請記住，沒有達成目標不表示專案完全失敗。您可能有目的地設定了一個延伸性目標來挑戰自我或團隊。即便沒有設定延伸目標，更重要的是要冷靜評估沒有實現目標的原因，而不是假裝沒有這回事。這樣，您就可以從錯誤中吸取教訓，在下次設定 SMART 目標時加以參考。 SMART 目標能夠讓目標設定與專案管理變的清楚明晰，從而協助團隊獲致成功。當團隊能夠清晰掌握且方向一致時，也能更加動力十足，知道需要優先進行哪些工作。 您想擁有積極遠大的目標嗎？請閱讀如何設定龐大、刺激、勇敢的目標 (BHAG)。",

              "content": "新 SMART 原則給目標管理好的開始！用 3 個範例快速上手 SMART 原則是目標管理的經典方法之一，透過這項方法進行目標設定，能確保目標可被量化與衡量並實現。Forrester 的研究指出，有效的目標設定和管理策略能賦予從業者更強的工作目的¹。而在管理學大師彼得．杜拉克（Peter Drucker）提出的 SMART 原則上，輔導過多家企業轉型變革的潘奎佑老師延伸打造出了新 SMART 原則。一起來認識新 SMART 原則，和以此為基礎的工作目標設定範例，把目標設定得更好更精準吧！ 快速跳轉目錄 新 SMART 原則是什麼？對目標管理有什麼幫助？ 由彼得．杜拉克提出的 SMART 原則建議設定目標時應依循 5 個法則，分別是 Specific（明確的）、Measurable（可衡量的）、Achievable（可達成的）、Relevant（相關的）和 Time-based（時限的）。而潘奎佑老師將當中的 S、A 跟 R 調整為 Strategic（策略性）、Added Value（價值性）與 Rejection（稀少性），以 Strategic（策略性）、Measurable（可衡量的）、Added Value（價值性）、Rejection（稀少性）和 Timely（時限性）組成新 SMART 原則。 SMART 原則作為幫助執行目標管理的方法，最主要的功能就是讓我們能訂出好目標，但好目標的定義是什麼呢？潘奎佑老師認為好的目標應具備 4 大特點，分別是稀少、衡量、價值與策略。其中「稀少」可讓執行者集中資源與精力；「衡量」強調目標是要可以量化的；「價值」可凸顯主管與其他基層員工的差異；而「策略」則強調目標要與公司長期發展連結，並提升競爭優勢。因此新 SMART 原則除了保留 Measurable 對應衡量這個特點，又加上了 Strategic、Added Value 和 Rejection 分別對應策略、價值與稀少的特點，幫助使用者能更精準地訂出好目標並讓目標管理有一個好的開始。 新 SMART 原則：MRT 新 SMART 原則將目標設定拆解為「宏觀的管理本質」與「微觀的運作技術」兩大塊，而 MRT 被歸類在後者，聚焦在目標需具有明確時間點，以及可量化和具體的可行性。相較原始的 SMART 原則，更強調「專注於少數目標」的重要性。其中的 M 與 T 關注的是衡量性，落實在工作目標設定上可使用「差距法」來實踐。而 R 則強調稀有性，實際應用時可利用「目標自檢工作表」來達成，以下分別舉例說明如何應用差距法和目標自檢工作表來進行目標管理。 工作目標設定範例：差距法（SMART - M、T） 工作目標設定範例：差距法（SMART - M、T） 所謂的差距法就是把現況與目標間的差距當作衡量目標達成的指標，並確保目標能在時限內達成。也就是說我們關注的點是在幾年幾月幾日之前，要達到什麼樣的狀態。這個方法在執行上需分別考慮時間（於什麼時間）、動詞（完成什麼事）和狀態（達成什麼效果）這 3 個面向，其中我們在列要「完成什麼事」的時候，可利用「動詞 + 主要任務或活動」的句型。 這邊我們以業務經理的「提高公司營收」願景為例，透過差距法列出 3 個具備可衡量性的目標描述。 範例一 - 時間：20xx 年 6 月 30 日前 - 動詞：提升市場佔有率 - 狀態：至 20%（較去年成長 5%） 範例二 - 時間：20xx 年 12 月 31 日前 - 動詞：提高 A 產品銷售額 - 狀態：至 12 億（較去年成長 10%） 範例三 - 時間：20xx 年 12 月 31 日前 - 動詞：提升利潤貢獻度 - 狀態：達 1.2 億（較去年成長 12%） 工作目標設定範例：目標自檢（SMART - R） 工作目標設定範例：目標自檢（SMART - R） 目標自檢的目的在於聚焦組織的首要目標。透過 8 個特性的檢核，分清楚目標的輕重緩急，最後篩選出 2～3 個最需要集中心力達成的重要目標。會需要這個法則是因為如果我們有一大列的目標，在沒有區分出差異和優先順序時，很容易被大量的工作綁架，雖然忙得灰頭土臉，卻拿不出具體成效。 以下同樣以業務經理的目標為例，透過具備 8 個目標特性檢核的自檢表，辨別各個目標的重要性。 - 規劃新年度的主要開發產業：符合 5 項，重要性中 - 邀請客戶參加公司行銷活動：符合 3 項，重要性中 - 製作新產品的提案企劃書：符合 6 項，重要性高 - 處理客戶對產品與服務的疑問：符合 2 項，重要性低 言果學習，讓培訓帶來具體成果 新 SMART 原則：SA 前面介紹了在新 SMART 原則中屬於微觀運作技術的 MRT，接著我們改將目光放在屬於宏觀管理本質的 SA。它聚焦於所有管理者的目標需緊扣公司願景及核心價值，並有助於公司的長期發展，相較原始的 SMART 原則，更強調思考「目標的策略與效益」。其中 S 關注的是策略性；A 則強調價值性，落實在工作目標設定上可使用「AB 績效模型」來實踐。以下一樣透過範例帶大家了解如何應用 AB 績效模型進行目標管理。 工作目標設定範例：AB 績效模型（SMART - S、A） 工作目標設定範例：AB 績效模型（SMART - S、A） AB 績效模型由管理者的 A（Added Value）績效目標與 B（Base）績效目標組合而成。其中 A 績效目標必須要能凸顯管理者的附加價值，並和公司競爭力有關，設定時可思考目標是否具備「策略長期」、「突破創新」、「營運管理改善」和「微創新」這 4 個特點。而 B 績效目標則是管理者可讓團隊或部屬去完成的基本績效，通常較著眼於單純的數字增減。 為讓大家可更清楚地看出 A、B 績效目標的差異，這邊以屬於高階管理者的業務副總為例來套用 AB 績效模型。 - A 績效目標： - 重新定義、挖掘與細分市場，今年底創造 5000 萬美元的收入 - 打造新盈利模式，202X 年底創造 1 億美元的新收入 - 延伸優勢進入新行業新市場，202X 年底創造 2 億美元的收入 - B 績效目標： - 今年 12 月 31 日前，提高銷售額至 9.5 億美元 分享至： 關於作者 言果學習 為企業探索發展人才的可能性 主要提供人才培訓方案給企業客戶，客戶群集中在台灣千大企業與外商公司，目前有將近80位來自各領域的講師與顧問團隊，協助企業規劃與執行課程，課程囊括企業經營、人才管理等範疇，是綜合型的專業培訓團隊。 主要提供人才培訓方案給企業客戶，客戶群集中在台灣千大企業與外商公司，目前有將近80位來自各領域的講師與顧問團隊，協助企業規劃與執行課程，課程囊括企業經營、人才管理等範疇，是綜合型的專業培訓團隊。 猜你會喜歡 所有文章",

              "content": "硕士论文数据太难找怎么办 硕士论文数据太难找怎么办？硕士论文是研究生阶段的重要学术成果，而数据收集作为论文研究的基础环节，常常成为许多研究生面临的首要难题。在当今信息爆炸的时代，看似数据无处不在，但真正符合学术研究要求的高质量数据却往往难以获取。本文将从数据收集的主要困难入手，系统分析问题根源，并提供切实可行的解决方案，帮助研究生突破数据收集的瓶颈，顺利完成论文写作。 一、数据收集面临的主要困难 1.1 专业领域数据稀缺性 许多前沿学科或细分研究领域存在天然的数据稀缺问题。以生物医学工程为例，某些罕见病的研究数据可能全球仅有几例；在社会科学领域，特定人群（如少数族裔、特殊职业群体）的详细数据往往难以获取。这种稀缺性源于多方面因素：研究对象的特殊性、数据采集成本高昂、伦理审查严格等。当研究生选择较为新颖或小众的研究方向时，常常会发现前人积累的公开数据极为有限，甚至完全没有可直接使用的现成数据。 1.2 数据获取权限限制 学术机构和商业组织收集的高价值数据往往设置严格的访问权限。例如，金融领域的交易数据、医疗机构的患者病历、政府部门的统计资料等，通常需要复杂的申请流程和审批手续。许多研究生反映，即使知道某数据库包含所需信息，也常因机构权限、高昂费用或保密协议而无法获取。更令人沮丧的是，有时经过漫长的申请等待后，最终得到的却是数据使用受到诸多限制的\"阉割版\"资料。 1.3 数据质量参差不齐 互联网上的海量数据看似丰富，实则质量堪忧。社交媒体数据存在大量噪声和虚假信息；开放数据库可能缺乏必要的元数据和说明文档；各类统计年鉴的数据口径可能前后不一致。研究生在筛选数据时，常常需要花费大量时间验证数据的真实性、完整性和一致性。更棘手的是，低质量数据一旦被用于分析，可能导致研究结论出现系统性偏差，这对学术严谨性构成严重威胁。 1.4 数据采集成本过高 一手数据的采集往往需要投入大量时间、金钱和人力。心理学实验需要招募受试者并进行严格控制；市场调研需要设计问卷并确保样本代表性；工程测试可能需要特殊设备和场地。对经费有限的研究生而言，这些成本常常超出承受能力。即使获得导师的部分支持，数据采集过程也可能会显著延长研究周期，影响论文进度。 二、系统化的解决方案 2.1 充分利用现有学术资源 2.1.1 深度挖掘开放学术数据库 全球范围内已有大量高质量的开放获取数据库可供利用。自然科学领域有GenBank、PDB等生物数据库；社会科学有ICPSR、世界银行开放数据等；工程领域有IEEE DataPort、NASA技术报告等。研究生应系统梳理本领域的核心数据库资源，了解其收录范围和使用条款。许多数据库虽然不完全符合研究需求，但通过数据清洗和二次加工，可能衍生出有价值的研究素材。 2.1.2 善用文献中的次级数据 已有学术论文常包含可供再利用的数据。通过仔细阅读相关文献的方法论部分和附录，常能发现作者公开的部分原始数据或处理后的数据集。合理引用这些\"数据中的data\"，既能解决燃眉之急，又能与前人研究形成对话。需要注意的是，这种做法必须严格遵守学术规范，明确标注数据来源，并尽量与原作者沟通确认。 2.2 创新数据收集方法 2.2.1 采用替代性数据源 当传统数据源不可得时，寻找替代方案是务实之举。例如，研究消费者行为可分析电商平台的公开评价而非机密交易数据；研究城市发展可利用卫星遥感影像替代实地测绘；研究语言现象可抓取新闻网站而非付费语料库。这种\"曲线救国\"的策略要求研究者灵活调整研究方法，有时能意外发现新的研究视角。 2.2.2 开展协作式数据收集 联合其他研究者开展数据共享合作能显著降低成本。可通过学术论坛、专业会议或社交媒体发起协作倡议，汇集多方资源共同建设研究数据库。例如，多个实验室联合开展跨区域调查，各自负责本地样本，最终共享整合后的数据集。这种方式尤其适合需要大样本但单个研究者资源有限的情况。 2.3 提升数据处理能力 2.3.1 掌握数据清洗与重构技术 面对不完美的数据，强大的处理能力可以\"变废为宝\"。学习使用Python、R等工具进行数据清洗、缺失值填补、异常值处理是当代研究者的必备技能。对于不完整的数据集，可运用多重插补、最大似然估计等统计方法进行合理修补；对于异构数据，可通过数据融合技术提取有用信息。 2.3.2 运用模拟与仿真方法 当实证数据确实无法获取时，计算机模拟可作为补充手段。基于已有理论和部分真实参数，构建数学模型或仿真系统，生成符合理论预期的模拟数据。这种方法在理论物理、计算社会科学等领域已有成熟应用。需注意的是，模拟结果必须与有限的真实数据进行交叉验证，并明确说明方法的局限性。 三、策略性调整研究设计 3.1 合理缩小研究范围 当数据困境难以突破时，适当调整研究焦点可能是明智选择。将宽泛的研究问题聚焦到数据可支撑的具体维度，或从宏观描述转向微观机制分析。例如，将\"中国制造业创新研究\"缩小为\"长三角地区新能源汽车零部件企业创新模式研究\"，数据需求将大幅降低而学术价值未必减少。 3.2 采用质性研究方法补充 定量数据不足时，质性方法可提供深度洞察。通过访谈、参与观察、文献分析等手段获取的质性数据，虽在代表性上有所局限，但能揭示定量数据难以捕捉的复杂过程和内在机理。混合方法研究设计（Mixed Methods）正成为应对数据挑战的有效范式，既能保证论证严谨性，又增强了研究发现的丰富度。 3.3 重构理论框架与假设 数据限制有时迫使研究者重新思考理论预设。与其强求验证初始假设，不如根据可获得的数据特点，调整理论视角或提出新的解释框架。这种\"由数据驱动\"的理论调适不是妥协，而是科学研究中正常的迭代过程，常常能产生原创性见解。 四、建立系统化支持网络 4.1 充分利用导师与学术团队资源 导师和课题组往往掌握着宝贵的学术资源和人脉网络。研究生应主动寻求指导，了解课题组已有的数据积累和合作渠道。许多时候，通过导师引荐可以获得正常情况下难以接触的数据资源，或获得专业的数据收集建议。 4.2 参与学术社区与开放科学运动 加入专业学会、订阅学术邮件列表、关注领域内核心研究者的工作，都能及时获取数据共享机会。近年来兴起的开放科学运动提倡数据共享，许多研究者愿意在确保学术信用的情况下分享数据。积极参与这些社区，既能解决当前的数据需求，也有助于长期学术发展。 4.3 善用院校支持服务 大学图书馆、数据中心、统计咨询中心等机构通常提供专业的数据服务。这些部门不仅拥有各类数据库的机构访问权限，还能提供数据管理计划咨询、统计分析支持等服务。许多研究生对这些\"隐形资源\"利用不足，错失了解决数据问题的有效渠道。",

"本文详细探讨了睡眠与健康之间的深刻关系，强调睡眠对身体和心理健康的重要性。文章指出，睡眠不足会增加心脏病、高血压、肥胖等多种健康风险，并加剧焦虑和抑郁等心理问题。特别是斯坦福大学的研究揭示，晚睡者患抑郁症的风险更高。凯斯西储大学成立的睡眠与生物节律科学合作组（SCSC）致力于推动睡眠研究，强调其在护理实践中的重要性。文章指出，护士睡眠不足会显著影响认知功能和护理质量，并提出通过教育、改善工作条件和个人干预来提升睡眠质量的措施。最后，文章呼吁社会各界重视睡眠健康，推动相关政策实施，以期未来能有更多创新干预措施，提升整体社会健康水平。根据文章长度，预计阅读时间约为5-8分钟。 更新时间：2025年06月05日 更新内容：根据2024年发表在《科学报告》上的研究成果，更新了“睡眠对护理实践的影响”一节中关于护士睡眠不足对工作表现影响的具体研究信息，包括研究发表年份、机构和研究方法，并补充了该研究的意义。 引言：睡眠与健康的关系 在当今快节奏的生活中，睡眠常常被人们视为可有可无的奢侈品。然而，研究表明，睡眠对我们的身体和心理健康至关重要。根据美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）2025年的最新数据显示，约36.5%的美国成年人报告睡眠不足，这不仅影响他们的日常生活，还可能导致严重的健康问题。睡眠不足的潜在风险包括心脏病、高血压、肥胖以及免疫功能下降等。具体来说，长期睡眠不足会使心脏病风险增加20%，高血压风险增加15%，肥胖风险增加30%，并导致免疫细胞活性下降50%，使身体更容易受到感染[12]。 首先，睡眠对身体健康的影响是显而易见的。充足的睡眠有助于身体恢复和能量补充，促进新陈代谢，并调节激素的分泌。研究显示，长期睡眠不足会导致体重增加，因为缺乏睡眠会干扰调节食欲的激素，导致人们更容易感到饥饿。此外，睡眠不足还会增加心血管疾病的风险，研究发现，睡眠不足与高血压和心脏病之间存在显著的相关性[5]。 而在心理健康方面，睡眠的影响同样不容忽视。许多研究表明，睡眠不足不仅会加剧焦虑和抑郁等心理健康问题，还可能是这些问题的诱因。比如，失眠症患者比没有睡眠问题的人更容易发展为抑郁症，风险高达两倍[2]。睡眠质量差还会导致认知功能下降，表现为注意力不集中、记忆力减退和情绪波动等症状。这种恶性循环让许多人陷入了焦虑和抑郁的深渊，难以自拔。 不仅如此，睡眠的时间安排也对心理健康有着重要影响。最近的研究发现，晚睡者（即“夜猫子”）在心理健康方面的风险明显高于早睡者。根据斯坦福大学（Stanford University）在2024年5月发布的一项研究，夜间活动与焦虑和抑郁症状之间存在显著的正相关关系。这项研究由斯坦福大学（2025USNews美国大学排名：4）医学院的精神病学和行为科学助理教授杰米·利奇（Jamie Zeitzer）领导，分析了超过73,000名参与者的数据，发现“夜猫子”患抑郁症的风险比早睡者高出10%至20%。研究指出，这种联系可能与身体对光照的反应有关，即“光线时窗效应”。在白天，光线能够帮助调节我们的情绪，但当人们在不该暴露于强光的时间（如夜间）活动时，光线反而可能对情绪产生负面影响，从而增加患精神疾病的风险。研究强调，调整睡眠时间，确保在合理的时间入睡，可能对改善心理健康具有积极作用[3, 4]。 综上所述，睡眠不仅是生理需求，更是心理健康的重要基石。面对现代生活压力，许多人可能会忽视睡眠的重要性，然而，科学研究不断强调，良好的睡眠习惯对于维护身心健康至关重要。因此，提升公众对睡眠的重视程度，培养良好的睡眠习惯，已成为当务之急。对于那些面临睡眠问题的人，及早寻求专业帮助，采取有效的干预措施，才能更好地维护自己的健康。 睡眠研究的最新进展 在这一背景下，凯斯西储大学（Case Western Reserve University）于2022年成立了睡眠与生物节律科学合作组（SCSC），这标志着对睡眠研究的重视程度进一步提升。该合作组由六位专注于不同人群和健康状态的护士科学家组成，旨在深入探讨睡眠及其生物节律对健康的影响。该合作组的成立不仅是学术界对睡眠研究的回应，更是对日益严重的睡眠不足问题的积极应对。 SCSC的目标是通过跨学科的合作，整合各自的专业知识和资源，推动睡眠科学研究的进展。正如该组的共同主席Stephanie Griggs和Valerie Toly所强调的，睡眠研究应与饮食和身体活动并列，成为健康维护的核心要素[1]。研究表明，缺乏睡眠会导致多种健康风险，包括冠心病、高血压、肥胖等，因此，研究睡眠的各个方面具有重要意义[10, 11]。 在研究方向上，SCSC不仅关注不同年龄段和性别群体的睡眠模式，还深入探讨睡眠对各种健康状况的影响。例如，研究发现，慢性睡眠不足与心理健康问题密切相关，尤其是焦虑和抑郁症状的加重。根据CDC的数据，约36.5%的美国成年人报告睡眠不足，而这一现象在心理健康问题患者中更为普遍[12]。SCSC正致力于通过多样化的研究项目，揭示睡眠质量和时间安排对心理健康的深远影响。 在2023年，SCSC发布了一项关于睡眠与心理健康之间关系的研究成果，发现规律的睡眠模式与心理健康显著相关。研究显示，保持一致的睡眠时间能够显著降低焦虑和抑郁的症状，尤其是在年轻人群体中[1]。这一发现为改善睡眠质量提供了新的视角，强调了在日常生活中保持规律作息的重要性。 此外，SCSC的研究还与其他相关领域的发现相辅相成。近期的一项研究指出，睡眠时间的选择对心理健康有显著影响，早睡者的心理健康状况往往优于夜猫子[3]。研究表明，保持规律的作息时间，尤其是晚上早点入睡，能够显著降低焦虑和抑郁的风险[4]。这一发现为SCSC的研究提供了重要的理论支持，强调了睡眠与心理健康之间的密切关系。 在睡眠科学日益受到重视的今天，SCSC的成立标志着一个全新的研究阶段。通过促进跨学科的合作，SCSC不仅希望提升对睡眠重要性的认识，还希望为未来的护理实践提供科学依据。随着研究的深入，SCSC将为改善人们的睡眠质量和心理健康提供更为有效的干预措施，助力人们在快节奏的生活中找到健康的平衡。 总之，睡眠不仅是身体恢复的必要条件，更是心理健康的重要基石。随着SCSC等研究机构的努力，未来我们有望看到更多关于睡眠科学的突破性发现，从而更好地应对现代社会中普遍存在的睡眠问题。通过科学研究与实践的结合，我们或许能够为人们提供更有效的睡眠管理策略，帮助他们在生活中实现身心健康的和谐统一。 睡眠对护理实践的影响 在护理领域，睡眠的质量和数量直接影响护理人员的工作表现和病人护理质量。众所周知，护士是医疗系统中不可或缺的一部分，他们的工作不仅需要高水平的专业技能，还需要良好的认知功能和情绪稳定性。然而，许多护士因长时间的轮班工作和不规律的生活方式而面临严重的睡眠问题。这种情况不仅影响他们的健康，也可能危及到病人的安全和护理质量[8]。 研究表明，睡眠不足会导致认知能力的下降，包括注意力、反应时间和决策能力的减弱。例如，2024年发表在《科学报告》（Scientific Reports）上的一项由伊朗研究人员进行的调查发现，护理人员在睡眠质量较差的情况下，认知功能显著下降，导致工作效率降低[7]。该研究采用了一项横断面调查设计，通过问卷调查和认知功能测试，评估了伊朗医疗机构护士的睡眠质量与工作表现之间的关系。具体而言，该研究显示，睡眠不足的护士在执行任务时的错误率增加了30%，并且在处理复杂情况时的反应时间延长了25%[7]。这项研究的发现为理解护士睡眠问题如何影响患者安全和护理质量提供了具体的证据，强调了改善护士睡眠卫生的紧迫性。这些结果也与全球其他地区类似研究的发现相呼应，例如，一项针对美国护士的调查显示，约60%的护士承认在工作期间经历过疲劳和注意力不集中，这增加了医疗错误的风险[8]。 此外，睡眠不足还与情绪波动和心理健康问题密切相关。许多护士在经历长时间的高压工作后，往往会感到焦虑和抑郁，这些情绪问题反过来又会影响他们的睡眠质量。根据美国精神病学协会的研究，睡眠障碍与焦虑和抑郁症状之间存在双向关系，失眠可能加剧这些心理健康问题[2]。对于护理人员来说，良好的心理状态是提供高质量护理的基础，因此，管理好睡眠问题至关重要。 在护理实践中，有效管理睡眠问题是提高护理质量和病人安全的关键。首先，医疗机构应当建立一个支持性的工作环境，鼓励护士在工作中合理安排休息时间，以减少疲劳和压力。研究表明，适当的休息和轮班制度能够显著改善护士的睡眠质量。例如，提供灵活的排班选项和定期的休息时间，可以帮助护理人员更好地调节生物钟，提升整体睡眠质量。 其次，医院管理层应当重视睡眠教育，提升护理人员对睡眠卫生的认识。通过开展睡眠健康讲座和培训，帮助护理人员了解良好的睡眠习惯，如保持规律的作息时间、避免在临睡前使用电子设备等，可以有效改善他们的睡眠质量[9]。此外，医院还可以提供心理健康支持，帮助护理人员应对工作压力，从而间接提升他们的睡眠质量。 最后，护士们自己也应当主动采取措施改善睡眠。例如，建立良好的睡前习惯，创造一个适宜的睡眠环境，避免咖啡因和酒精的摄入，都是有助于提高睡眠质量的有效策略。通过这些方法，护理人员不仅能改善自己的健康状况，还能在工作中保持更高的警觉性和效率，从而更好地照顾病人。 综上所述，睡眠对护理人员的工作表现和病人护理质量有着深远的影响。通过有效的管理和支持措施，可以帮助护理人员改善睡眠质量，进而提升整个医疗系统的效率和安全性。随着对睡眠研究的深入，我们期待看到更多针对护理人员睡眠问题的解决方案，最终实现护理质量的全面提升。 公共卫生中的睡眠干预措施 在公共卫生领域，改善人群的睡眠质量不仅是一个重要的健康议题，更是提升整体社会健康水平的关键。通过教育和政策干预，我们可以有效地改善人们的睡眠习惯，从而减少因睡眠不足引发的健康问题。许多成功的案例和策略为我们提供了宝贵的经验。 首先，提高对睡眠卫生的认识是改善睡眠质量的首要步骤。教育机构和社区组织可以通过开展宣传活动、讲座和工作坊，向公众普及睡眠卫生的重要性。例如，推广良好的睡眠习惯，如保持规律的作息时间、创造适宜的睡眠环境、避免在临睡前使用电子设备等，能够显著提高人们的睡眠质量。研究显示，增强公众对睡眠卫生的认识能够有效降低睡眠障碍的发生率，进而改善整体健康水平[9]。 其次，改善工作条件也是提高睡眠质量的重要策略。许多职业，尤其是医护人员，经常面临轮班工作和长时间工作的压力，这直接影响了他们的睡眠质量[8]。政府和医疗机构可以通过制定相关政策，推动灵活的排班制度，确保员工能够获得足够的休息时间。此外，提供心理健康支持和压力管理培训，有助于缓解因工作引发的焦虑和压力，从而改善睡眠质量。 针对特定人群的干预措施也显得尤为重要。例如，针对医护人员的睡眠问题，许多医院开始实施“健康护士计划”，通过提供睡眠教育和心理支持，帮助护士管理工作压力，改善他们的睡眠质量。研究表明，接受过睡眠卫生培训的医护人员，其睡眠质量显著提高，工作效率和病人护理质量也随之改善[9]。 在学生群体中，睡眠问题同样严重。许多学生因学业压力和不规律的作息时间而面临睡眠不足的问题。学校可以通过开展睡眠健康教育，帮助学生建立良好的作息习惯。此外，学校还可以为学生提供心理咨询服务，帮助他们应对学业压力，从而改善睡眠质量。 政府和医疗机构在促进良好睡眠习惯方面的角色不可忽视。通过立法和政策支持，政府可以推动睡眠健康的公共卫生战略。例如，制定针对工作场所的健康政策，鼓励企业为员工提供健康的工作环境和合理的休息时间。此外，政府还可以支持睡眠研究，资助相关项目，以便更深入地了解睡眠与健康之间的关系，从而制定更加有效的干预措施。 总而言之，通过教育和政策干预，我们可以有效改善人群的睡眠质量，进而提升整体健康水平。无论是通过提高睡眠卫生的认识、改善工作条件，还是针对特定人群的干预措施，都是促进良好睡眠习惯的重要手段。政府和医疗机构在这一过程中扮演着至关重要的角色，期待未来能有更多的成功案例和有效策略，为人们的健康保驾护航。 结论与未来展望 睡眠的重要性不仅体现在个人健康层面，更在于其对社会整体健康的深远影响。随着对睡眠研究的深入，越来越多的证据表明，睡眠质量的提升不仅能够改善个体的生活质量，还能降低医疗费用，减少因健康问题导致的社会负担。因此，未来的睡眠研究应当更加注重跨学科的合作，结合心理学、营养学和社会学等领域的知识，共同寻找创新的干预措施。 例如，结合现代科技与睡眠研究，开发智能化的睡眠监测设备，将为人们提供个性化的睡眠建议，帮助他们更好地管理自己的睡眠习惯。此外，在护理实践中，护士们可以通过接受睡眠健康的专业培训，成为患者睡眠管理的积极推动者，帮助患者建立良好的睡眠模式。 呼吁社会各界重视睡眠健康，推动相关政策的实施同样至关重要。政府应当将睡眠健康纳入公共卫生政策，制定相关法规，鼓励企业和机构为员工提供良好的工作环境和充足的休息时间。通过这些措施，我们可以期待一个更加注重睡眠、促进健康的社会环境，从而提升整体的生活质量和幸福感。 参考资料： - Nursing School Collaborative Enhances Research on Sleep and

According to disease classification systems, sleep disorders can be categorized into more than 90 types, including sleep apnea, insomnia, and hypersomnia. It may cause a variety of adverse consequences, such as depression, anxiety and other emotional disorders, as well as physical diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and stroke. In addition, the relevant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment not only harm physical health, but also are associated with workplace accidents and safety problems, constituting public safety hazards. Sleep disorders have become a major social and scientific problem that impacts on the national economy and the livelihood of the people. Research on sleep disorders should be given more attention by researchers and policy makers. Herein, we mainly discussed the latest findings and difficulties concerning research on the prevention and intervention of sleep disorders and proposed strategies and suggestions accordingly. Keywords: Sleep disorders, Sleep research, Research on mental disorders, Prevention and control 睡眠是人类最基础的生理需求，睡眠不仅是维持机体正常生长发育的重要途径，还对记忆的稳定和整合起着至关重要的作用[1]。近年来，随着经济社会发展，人们受到生活工作压力增大以及生活方式变化等多重因素的影响，睡眠障碍问题日益凸显。睡眠障碍可影响身体、心理、社交和情绪功能，且在成人和儿童等各年龄阶段中都很常见。睡眠障碍种类很多，2017年，美国睡眠医学学会（The American Academy of Sleep Medicine）发布的《睡眠障碍国际分类第3版》（International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition, ICSD-3）将睡眠障碍主要分为七大类，包括失眠（insomnia）、睡眠相关呼吸障碍（sleep-related breathing disorders）、中枢性嗜睡症（central disorders of hypersomnolence）、昼夜节律睡眠-觉醒障碍（circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders）、睡眠异态（parasomnias）、睡眠相关运动障碍（sleep-related movement disorders）和其他睡眠障碍[2]。目前，睡眠障碍相关重大疾病研究已逐渐成为全球各国科技创新的重要布局方向之一，但该领域相关研究尚处于起步阶段，存在诸多瓶颈。我国睡眠医学起步较晚，且随着人口老龄化加剧，所面临的睡眠障碍相关重大疾病的防控挑战也与国际上有所不同。本文基于文献检索分析和专家咨询等方法，梳理了国内外睡眠障碍相关重大疾病的防控现状和挑战，并就下一步科技工作提出几点对策与建议，以期为未来睡眠医学领域的政策制定及研究、管理工作提供参考。 1. 全球睡眠障碍及相关重大疾病的防控面临瓶颈 2013年5月，美国发布《精神障碍诊断与统计手册（第五版）》（Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, DSM-5），将第四版中“原发性失眠症（primary insomnia）”的诊断改为失眠障碍（insomnia disorder）[3-4]，诊断标准包括入睡困难或维持睡眠困难或早醒且不能再入睡而影响日间社会功能，频率为每周至少出现3晚、持续3个月以上等[5]。然而，DSM-5以及ICSD-3对于失眠障碍诊断标准的调整或更新主要是针对临床或科研实践进行完善而不是发现了新的研究证据[6]。除此之外，睡眠呼吸障碍也是睡眠障碍中十分常见的一种，包括阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（obstructive sleep apnea, OSA）、中枢型睡眠呼吸暂停以及睡眠相关的低通气和低氧血症[7]。目前，睡眠障碍相关重大疾病研究成为全球各国脑科学领域布局的重要方向之一，包括近年来相继启动的美国的“大脑（BRAIN）”计划、欧盟的“神经退行性疾病联合研究（Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research, JPND）”计划、日本的“脑/思维（Brain/MINDS）”计划以及韩国脑计划（Korea Brain Initiative）等均涉及睡眠障碍发病机制及防治策略相关研究。总体来讲，全球睡眠障碍的相关探索研究尚处于起步阶段，主要存在以下两方面亟待解决的重要问题： 一是诊断上缺乏客观生物学标准。临床检查手段可反映的患者生物学标志信息十分有限，大多依赖问卷调查，缺乏预测模型以及评估患者预后的客观方法。关于睡眠障碍的神经机理研究多采用脑电图及多导睡眠图等作为主要技术手段，只能反映大脑皮层大尺度范围内的神经元集体电活动信息，难以全面揭示复杂神经环路和脑网络特征。通过功能磁共振成像等技术虽可为睡眠障碍的神经机理研究提供新视角，但单一研究模式所获信息仍有局限，无法全面反映脑网络和神经环路的信息流动。目前，各国都在推进该领域科研攻关，旨在通过整合多导睡眠图、多模态成像技术等新型及传统脑功能研究手段，进行睡眠障碍不同维度脑网络的精准构建和深入分析，结合人群队列随访研究，深入理解睡眠障碍及相关疾病脑功能的生理学变化机制，促进睡眠障碍干预技术创新，为睡眠障碍诊疗水平提升保驾护航。 二是临床干预手段有限。现有干预手段难以达到临床治愈，均以对症为主，主要包括药物及非药物治疗。药物治疗存在多种不良反应，不适宜作为长期治疗手段。美国睡眠医学学会建议进行心理和行为干预，并辅以短期药物治疗[8-9]，心理和行为介入包括失眠认知行为疗法（CBT-I）、单/多成分干预行为疗法和认知重建以及睡眠卫生教育等手段[10]。近年来，随着人工智能技术及大数据的发展，国内外开发了许多远程CBT-I 治疗方式，然而这类非药物治疗存在操作复杂、经济成本高等缺点，限制了其在中低收入国家的推广应用。 上述困境的主要原因是大脑在睡眠障碍相关疾病中的功能变化及神经、遗传机制尚不明确，睡眠障碍的特异性标志物和风险因素也尚未阐明。这些关键性问题已成为寻找睡眠障碍个体化诊断体系的最大障碍，也是对其进行高效干预及疗效评价的瓶颈所在。 2. 我国睡眠障碍防控研究现状及面临的挑战 随着社会现代化和老龄化发展，睡眠障碍发病率迅速升高，以睡眠-觉醒障碍为例，全球发病率为27%，而我国高达38.2%[11-12]。根据我国睡眠研究会2021年3月发布的《2021年运动与睡眠白皮书》显示，我国有3亿多人面临睡眠障碍及相关问题[13]。 我国的睡眠医学研究起步较晚，开始于20世纪50年代，直到1994年，中国睡眠研究会正式成立后才逐渐发展进步[14]。此后，我国科研人员发表与睡眠相关文章的数量逐年增加。基于ClinicalTrials.gov注册平台的检索结果显示，2005年开始，我国科研人员参与的临床试验数量逐渐上升。截至目前，我国睡眠医学临床试验注册总量位居全球第三位（图1）。2014年以来，科技部、国家卫生健康委员会、中央军委后勤保障部和国家药品监督管理局共同布局建设了3家精神心理疾病领域的国家临床医学研究中心，现已初步形成了多地区协同的创新网络，搭建睡眠障碍相关临床研究的国家级平台，大力促进我国睡眠医学研究发展。2021年底，国内发布了首部《中国睡眠医学中心标准化建设指南》，该指南在借鉴国内外睡眠医学中心建设先进经验的基础上，结合我国睡眠医学中心建设的现状，为我国睡眠医学中心标准化建设与发展提供了依据和参考[15]。 自2009年开始，我国逐渐增加睡眠医学研究经费投入，总资助金额从 1988−2009 年的1000余万元增加为2010−2019年的1.5亿元[16]，“十二五”期间，国家自然科学基金委共批准150余项睡眠相关的课题项目，总金额达7500余万元[17]。“十四五”以来，通过国家重点研发计划“常见多发病防治研究”重点专项和科技部科技创新2030−“脑科学与类脑研究”重大项目等国家科技计划的部署，重点围绕睡眠障碍的发病机制、新型干预手段以及人群队列的建设进行攻关，以期进一步阐明相关作用机制，开发出睡眠障碍的新型干预手段。 尽管如此，我国睡眠障碍的防控工作仍面临以下四方面问题： 一是我国睡眠障碍人群的遗传特点与国外差异较大。睡眠-觉醒障碍、OSA等常见的睡眠障碍均系受到基因与环境交互作用影响的复杂多基因遗传病。近年来，复杂疾病遗传机制研究范式从单个致病基因研究转变为以基因、转录、蛋白、代谢多组学检测及关键分子调控网络分析为基础的系统生物学模式，而我国无论是睡眠障碍患者人群的风险位点研究，还是多组学研究均与国外存在一定差距。同时，因遗传异质性导致我国与其他亚、欧人群存在巨大差异，开展国人睡眠障碍疾病遗传研究，对于国人睡眠障碍相关疾病新基因靶点的发现、病因及发病机制的揭示十分必要，结合神经影像与神经调控技术的开发，将为进一步明确睡眠障碍的发病机制、探索全新治疗模式及精准医疗奠定基础。 二是现有临床干预手段仍存在局限性。针对慢性失眠的药物治疗存在“成瘾”风险，而如CBT-I等非药物治疗需要患者长期配合，在我国专业人员数量相对不足的背景下，难以满足患者的治疗需求[18]。此外，由于缺乏对慢性失眠发生发展机制的深入了解，我国临床上的治疗以对症为主，亟需开发特异性、针对性的新型治疗手段并进行临床验证和推广。近年来，相关科研成果不断涌现，一些新型非药物干预手段在慢性失眠防控中的发展潜力也逐渐体现，例如基于声、光、电和磁等刺激开发的新型技术（基于影像导航的Theta爆发式经颅磁刺激技术、闭环-经颅交流电刺激等）具有针对性强和安全性高等优点[19]，但其有效性尚未得到验证，具体治疗机制仍未阐明。 另一方面，对于OSA这一常见睡眠障碍，持续气道正压通气（continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP）是临床一线治疗方式。然而，我国近三分之二的OSA患者在明确诊断后拒绝接受治疗[20]。这可能与以下几点因素相关：①针对OSA这一疾病的宣教不足；②患者临床症状与OSA严重程度不匹配，超过60%的OSA患者日间疲乏等功能损害症状轻微，从而主观臆测自身病情不够严重，无需进行医疗干预[19]；③患者需自费购买治疗设备，治疗费用相对昂贵。同时，即使在选择接受治疗的人群中，我国OSA患者的治疗依从性差，仅有约30%～50%的OSA患者显示出对治疗依从，显著低于西方国家60%～70%的治疗依从率[21-22]。CPAP临床依从性差这一问题在我国尤其严重[21, 23]。 三是我国诊疗资源分布局限，缺乏智能化分级诊疗体系。我国睡眠障碍患者人数众多，且年龄段分布广泛，从儿童到老年人阶段均可能出现不同临床亚型的睡眠障碍，严重危害心身健康。此外，新型冠状病毒感染或加剧睡眠障碍的发生风险[24]。然而，我国睡眠医疗资源存在分布不均现象，部分三甲医院以及少数的二级医院设有睡眠障碍专科门诊和独立的睡眠监测室及治疗室，诊疗与患者需求的供需不平衡现象突出。我国目前的分级诊疗体系有待完善，由于各医院影像质量控制标准和实现程度不一，导致在医联体内推行影像互通互认存在一定难度[25]，迫切需要实行数据标准统一的智能化分级诊疗平台[26]。 四是睡眠障碍相关问题的公众认识水平有待提高[27]。多数人对于睡眠障碍问题不够重视，或存在睡眠健康知识误区，例如认为失眠不是病，或相关症状可以通过补觉代替[28]，饮酒助眠[29]，鼾声越大睡得越香等[30]。此外，因老年人对功能失调性睡眠障碍的心理机制了解不足，导致老年人安全感降低，加剧诱发失眠[31]。为此，国家卫生健康委员会发布的《健康中国行动（2019−2030年）》明确强调要重视睡眠健康，将改善睡眠纳入主要行动指标，并提出了一系列明确的目标要求[32]，以期提高公众对睡眠障碍重视程度，减轻国人睡眠障碍疾病医疗负担及相关经济损失。 3. 有关对策建议 为进一步促进我国睡眠医学研究发展，全面开展睡眠障碍相关疾病脑网络特征与神经、遗传调控机制的研究；阐明睡眠障碍发生发展机制；探索其遗传易感性及脑影像表征；建立早期诊断的综合预警体系和个体化干预策略等新型手段并进行临床验证和推广，是睡眠障碍及相关重大疾病防治的关键。具体建议包括以下三方面： 3.1. 统筹科研部署，完善睡眠障碍相关研究体系 将目前已布局项目进行整合，促进我国睡眠障碍相关研究优势力量和不同地区之间的相互协作，对标国际上睡眠障碍防控研究的前沿进展和趋势，找准科技突破口，进一步明确我国睡眠障碍防控研究的近期、中期和远期目标及任务。加强调动院所、高校、企业的创新积极性，建立基于不同临床亚型的睡眠障碍多中心大队列，实现疾病靶标发现，并构建适宜中国人群的睡眠障碍风险预测模型和预后评估体系，为临床决策和优化医疗资源配置提供循证依据；完成重大关键技术突破以及重点睡眠产品的开发，为提高失眠障碍诊断的敏感性和特异性提供积极有效的科技支撑。 3.2. 推进跨学科合作，深化睡眠障碍的发病机制研究 应用神经调控技术（重复经颅磁刺激、经颅电刺激等）探索睡眠障碍的个体化干预方式有助于克服传统镇静催眠类药物对患者造成依赖性及成瘾性的弊端，且符合睡眠障碍个体化诊疗探索的国际趋势。因此，将神经调控技术与神经影像、电生理、神经内分泌、分子遗传、蛋白组学、肠道微生物等多学科技术融合，有助于明确睡眠障碍的发生发展机制，推动神经调控技术干预睡眠障碍的理论创新和个体化诊疗技术创新。 3.3. 强化我国精神心理疾病领域国家临床医学研究中心的辐射带动作用 以国家临床医学研究中心为依托，以临床应用为导向，构建完整系统的大型中国睡眠障碍人群队列，持续跟踪随访，采集睡眠障碍患者神经影像、电生理、神经内分泌、分子遗传、蛋白组学、肠道微生物数据，结合动物实验，探索不同种类睡眠障碍的有效预测因素和疾病预测模型，提出睡眠障碍调控新理论，为我国睡眠障碍相关诊疗方案的制定提供基础与临床科学证据。 总之，睡眠障碍的防控研究是关系国民健康和国民经济的重要问题，目前我国在该领域的研究应用正加速发展。科研攻关方面，国家科技计划的支持力度不断提升，未来建议进一步增强该领域科研人才培养，注重与信息技术等多学科的交叉融合，以突破现有技术瓶颈；在临床实践方面，未来建议注重基层心理和行为干预领域的专业人员培养，缓解医患供需不平衡的问题，并进一步注重搭建智能化的分级诊疗平台，充分发挥人工智能等创新技术在医疗服务和健康管理等方面的优势。

更新时间：2025年05月04日 更新内容：补充了MSU研究中关于亚裔、拉丁裔和多种族儿童与非西班牙裔白人儿童在睡眠持续时间、上床时间和波动性等方面的具体数据，并增加了对噪音污染、社区不安全感、医疗资源不足以及经济因素如何影响儿童睡眠的具体研究发现和案例。同时，在“研究背景与方法”部分增加了对“青少年大脑认知发展研究”（ABCD Study）的简要介绍，包括其总样本量、研究起始年份和目标。 引言：儿童睡眠健康的现状与重要性 儿童的睡眠健康是一个不容忽视的话题，它直接关系着孩子们的身体健康、情绪调节以及学习能力。随着社会的快速发展，儿童面临的挑战也在不断增加，尤其是在睡眠健康方面。根据密歇根州立大学（Michigan State University, MSU）的最新研究[^1]，种族和民族差异在儿童睡眠模式中显得尤为突出，尤其是对有色人种儿童的影响。这项研究不仅揭示了儿童睡眠时间的波动性，还强调了这些差异对儿童健康和发展的深远影响。 在这项研究中，研究人员使用了来自“青少年大脑认知发展研究”（Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study，ABCD Study）的数据，分析了3868名来自不同种族和民族背景的儿童的睡眠模式。结果显示，亚裔、黑人、拉丁裔和多种族儿童的睡眠时间普遍较短，且上床时间较晚，睡眠模式的波动性更大。具体而言，与非西班牙裔白人儿童相比，亚裔儿童的睡眠时间约短0.16小时，黑人儿童约短0.18小时，拉丁裔儿童约短0.19小时，多种族儿童约短0.15小时。在睡眠波动性方面，与非西班牙裔白人儿童相比，亚裔儿童的睡眠时间波动性增加约0.15小时，黑人儿童增加约0.19小时，拉丁裔儿童增加约0.18小时，多种族儿童增加约0.14小时[^1]。这些发现引发了对儿童睡眠健康的深刻反思，尤其是如何通过政策和教育来改善这一现状。 研究的领导者王怡杰教授指出，儿童的睡眠模式不仅仅是个体选择的结果，而是受到更广泛的结构性和社会文化因素的影响。例如，结构性种族主义、社区环境以及医疗保健的可及性等都在影响儿童的睡眠健康。对于生活在不利环境中的儿童而言，缺乏安全感、医疗资源不足以及高噪音和污染水平等因素都可能导致他们的睡眠质量下降。 因此，深入探讨这些问题至关重要。王教授呼吁教育工作者、政策制定者和医疗专业人士之间的合作，以应对影响儿童睡眠健康的系统性不平等。这项研究不仅填补了现有文献的空白，扩展了对不同种族和民族儿童睡眠模式的理解，还为未来的政策制定提供了重要参考。 在接下来的部分中，我们将详细探讨MSU研究的背景和方法，分析不同种族和民族儿童在睡眠持续时间、上床时间和起床时间等方面的差异，以及这些差异背后的社会文化因素。这将为我们提供更全面的视角，帮助我们理解儿童睡眠健康的不平等现象，并为改善这一现状提供有效的建议。 研究背景与方法：揭示儿童睡眠模式的差异 在这项由密歇根州立大学（2025USNews美国大学排名：63）（Michigan State University, MSU）进行的研究中，研究团队的主要目的是深入了解不同种族和民族儿童的睡眠模式差异，尤其是有色人种儿童相较于非西班牙裔白人儿童所面临的挑战。研究的核心数据来源于“青少年大脑认知发展研究”（Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study，简称ABCD Study），这是美国最大的一项儿童大脑发展和健康研究。ABCD Study于2015年启动，旨在通过为期10年的纵向研究，追踪超过11,000名9-10岁儿童的大脑发育和健康状况，以了解生物、行为和环境因素如何影响儿童的大脑发育和健康。该研究通过收集脑部影像、遗传数据、认知能力、心理健康、体格健康以及家庭和环境因素等多种数据，全面描绘儿童的成长轨迹。这项研究的广泛性和长期性为理解儿童发展提供了宝贵的数据资源。 MSU的研究分析了来自ABCD Study的3868名来自多元种族和民族背景的儿童的睡眠模式。这种广泛的样本选择对于确保研究结果的有效性和可靠性至关重要，能够反映出美国儿童睡眠健康的真实现状。 为了收集准确的数据，研究团队采用了腕带设备进行睡眠监测，这种方法能够客观地记录儿童的睡眠模式，包括睡眠持续时间、上床时间、起床时间和整体睡眠效率。通过监测儿童的运动和心率，研究人员能够深入分析睡眠的各个维度，并计算出睡眠的波动性。这种科学的方法论不仅提升了数据的准确性，也为分析不同种族和民族儿童的睡眠健康提供了坚实的基础。 研究的结果显示，亚裔、黑人、拉丁裔和多种族儿童在睡眠持续时间、上床时间和起床时间上存在显著差异。这些儿童的睡眠时间普遍较短，且上床时间较晚，表现出更大的睡眠波动性。具体而言，与非西班牙裔白人儿童相比，亚裔儿童的平均睡眠时间约短0.16小时，黑人儿童约短0.18小时，拉丁裔儿童约短0.19小时，多种族儿童约短0.15小时。在睡眠波动性方面，与非西班牙裔白人儿童相比，亚裔儿童的睡眠时间波动性增加约0.15小时，黑人儿童增加约0.19小时，拉丁裔儿童增加约0.18小时，多种族儿童增加约0.14小时[^1]。这些差异并不仅仅反映了个体行为或选择，而是深层次的社会结构和文化因素的体现。 王怡杰教授在研究中指出，影响儿童睡眠健康的因素是复杂的，涉及到结构性种族主义、社区环境以及医疗保健的可及性等多重维度。生活在高犯罪率、噪音和污染水平较高的社区的儿童，往往面临更大的睡眠挑战。缺乏安全感和健康资源的环境，显然会对儿童的睡眠质量产生负面影响。此外，经济因素也在其中扮演了重要角色，低收入家庭的儿童可能因为工作和家庭责任而牺牲睡眠，进一步加剧了睡眠健康的不平等。 通过这项研究，王教授和他的团队不仅填补了关于不同种族儿童睡眠模式的研究空白，还强调了在政策制定中需要关注的关键问题。研究结果呼吁政策制定者、教育工作者和医疗专业人士之间的合作，以应对影响儿童睡眠健康的系统性不平等。只有通过共同努力，才能确保所有儿童，尤其是来自边缘化社区的儿童，能够获得健康的睡眠环境，从而促进他们的身心发展。 在接下来的部分中，我们将进一步探讨影响儿童睡眠健康的社会文化因素，包括结构性种族主义、邻里环境和医疗保健的可及性等。这将为我们提供更全面的视角，帮助我们理解儿童睡眠健康的不平等现象，并为改善这一现状提供有效的建议。 影响儿童睡眠健康的社会文化因素 在探讨儿童睡眠健康的社会文化因素时，首先不得不提到结构性种族主义这一深层次的问题。研究表明，结构性种族主义不仅影响了人们的经济机会和社会地位，还在潜移默化中影响了儿童的生活环境和健康状况。许多有色人种儿童生活在资源匮乏的社区，这些地区往往缺乏安全的居住环境、优质的教育资源以及基本的医疗服务。这种环境的缺失直接导致了儿童睡眠质量的下降。 例如，居住在高犯罪率地区的儿童，因恐惧和不安全感而难以放松，进而影响他们的入睡时间和睡眠深度。根据一项研究[^7]，生活在噪音污染严重的社区的儿童，睡眠质量普遍较差，且更容易出现夜惊和失眠等问题。这些问题不仅影响了他们的睡眠模式，也对他们的学习能力和情绪调节产生了负面影响。一项发表在《心理健康与体育活动》杂志上的研究发现，社区环境的安全感水平与儿童的睡眠质量显著相关，生活在安全感较低社区的儿童，其夜间醒来次数和睡眠中断情况更频繁。 邻里环境的影响同样不可忽视。社区的社会资本，特别是邻里之间的信任和互助关系，能够为儿童提供一个安全的成长环境。高水平的社区凝聚力与儿童的心理健康和睡眠质量密切相关。研究发现，支持性强的社区能够有效缓解儿童在成长过程中面临的压力，从而促进他们的睡眠健康。而在缺乏这种支持的环境中，儿童更容易受到各种外部压力的影响，导致睡眠质量下降。一项针对美国大城市儿童的研究发现，居住在社会资本较低社区的儿童，其平均每晚睡眠时间比居住在社会资本较高社区的儿童少约20分钟。 医疗保健的可及性也是影响儿童睡眠健康的重要因素。许多低收入家庭由于缺乏医疗保险或经济负担，难以获得必要的健康服务。这使得儿童在面临睡眠问题时，无法及时得到专业的帮助与指导。研究显示，接受过专业睡眠评估和干预的儿童，其睡眠质量显著提高。相反，缺乏医疗资源的儿童则可能因为长期的睡眠不足而导致一系列健康问题，包括注意力缺陷、学习困难和情绪障碍[^6]。根据凯泽家庭基金会（Kaiser Family Foundation, KFF）的数据[^3]，有色人种家庭在医疗保健的可及性方面面临更大的障碍，这直接影响了儿童健康问题的早期发现和干预，包括睡眠问题。 经济因素同样在儿童睡眠模式中起着关键作用。许多低收入家庭的父母为了维持生计，往往需要长时间工作，导致家庭生活节奏紧张。这样的生活方式使得家庭成员难以保持规律的作息时间，儿童的睡眠时间也因此受到影响。根据一项调查，许多低收入家庭的儿童由于父母的工作安排，常常需要在夜间熬夜，或是早晨起得特别早，导致睡眠时间严重不足。一项发表在《儿科学》杂志上的研究发现，家庭收入水平与儿童的睡眠时间呈正相关，收入越低的家庭，儿童的平均睡眠时间越短。 此外，文化因素也在其中扮演着重要角色。不同文化对睡眠的理解和重视程度各不相同。例如，在一些文化中，家庭成员之间的亲密共眠被视为一种传统，可能会影响儿童的独立睡眠习惯。这种文化背景下，儿童的睡眠模式可能与主流社会的期望存在差异，从而导致对其睡眠健康的误解。 综上所述，影响儿童睡眠健康的社会文化因素是多维度的，涉及结构性种族主义、邻里环境、医疗保健的可及性以及经济和文化因素等。这些因素不仅影响儿童的睡眠质量，还对他们的学习能力和情绪发展产生深远影响[^5]。因此，解决儿童睡眠健康不平等的问题，需要从多个层面入手，综合考虑各类社会文化因素，以制定有效的政策和干预措施。 睡眠健康不平等的后果与影响 睡眠健康不平等对儿童发展的潜在后果，尤其是学习能力、情绪调节和整体健康，显然不容小觑。研究显示，不规律的睡眠模式会导致儿童在学习上遇到困难，情绪问题频发，甚至可能对他们的身体健康产生长期影响。尤其是那些来自低收入家庭或边缘化社区的儿童，他们的睡眠质量往往更低，面临的挑战也更为严峻。 首先，不规律的睡眠模式会直接影响儿童的学习能力。睡眠是学习和记忆的关键环节，研究表明，充足的睡眠有助于信息的巩固和整合。相反，缺乏睡眠的儿童在注意力、记忆力和问题解决能力上均表现不佳。比如，缺乏睡眠的儿童可能在课堂上难以集中注意力，导致学习成绩下降。更糟糕的是，这种学习困难可能会伴随他们整个学业生涯，进一步加剧教育不平等的现象。一项发表在《儿童发展》杂志上的研究发现，睡眠时间不足的儿童在认知测试中的表现明显低于睡眠充足的儿童。 其次，睡眠不平等还与情绪调节能力密切相关。研究发现，睡眠不足的儿童更容易出现焦虑、抑郁等情绪问题。他们的情绪波动可能更大，表现出易怒、情绪不稳定等特征。对于那些本就生活在压力环境中的儿童来说，睡眠问题更是如同雪上加霜。长期的睡眠不足会导致他们在面对生活挑战时缺乏应对能力，从而影响到社交能力和人际关系。一项针对学龄前儿童的研究发现，睡眠不足的儿童在社交场合更容易表现出攻击性和退缩行为。 此外，睡眠健康不平等的长期影响也不可忽视。研究表明，睡眠不足与多种身体健康问题相关，包括肥胖、糖尿病和心血管疾病等[^2][^6]。对于有色人种儿童来说，由于社会经济地位的限制，他们更容易受到这些健康问题的困扰。随着年龄的增长，睡眠不平等可能导致健康状况的进一步恶化，形成恶性循环。美国心脏协会（American Heart Association, AHA）指出，童年时期的睡眠不足是成年后心血管疾病的重要风险因素之一。 在不同种族和民族群体中，这些问题的加剧尤为明显。研究显示，亚裔、黑人、拉丁裔和多种族儿童在睡眠模式上展现出更大的波动性和不规律性，这直接影响到他们的学习和情绪健康。尤其是黑人儿童，因其生活环境中的各种压力，面临的睡眠挑战更加严峻[^2]。研究者王怡杰教授强调，这些差异不仅仅是个体行为的反映，更是深层次社会结构和文化因素的结果。 因此，面对如此严峻的现实，社会各界亟需对儿童睡眠健康不平等问题给予更多关注。教育工作者、政策制定者和医疗专业人士应当共同努力，推动政策和实践的改革，以确保所有儿童，尤其是来自边缘化社区的儿童，能够享有健康的睡眠环境[^8]。只有通过多方合作，才能真正改善儿童的睡眠质量，促进他们的健康成长[^9]。 政策建议与未来方向：促进睡眠健康公平 在应对儿童睡眠健康不平等的挑战时，政策建议的制定显得尤为重要。首先，改善社区环境是提升儿童睡眠健康的基础。政府和地方社区应致力于创造安全、安静的居住环境，减少噪音和污染，增加绿地和休闲空间。这不仅有助于提高儿童的睡眠质量，也能增强他们的整体福祉。例如，社区可以通过增加公园、运动场和社区活动中心，提供儿童和家庭更好的休闲和社交机会，从而减轻生活压力。一些研究表明，社区环境的改善，如降低噪音水平和增加绿色空间，能够显著提高居民的睡眠质量，对儿童的影响尤为明显。 其次，提高医疗保健的可及性同样至关重要。许多低收入家庭面临医疗资源匮乏的问题，导致儿童在出现睡眠问题时无法及时获得专业帮助。政府应推动医疗保险的改革，确保所有儿童，尤其是来自边缘化社区的孩子，能够享有必要的医疗服务。此外，提供针对儿童睡眠问题的教育和咨询服务，帮助家庭识别和应对睡眠障碍，能够有效提升儿童的睡眠健康。例如，可以通过社区健康中心或学校，开展面向家长和学生的睡眠健康知识普及活动，提高家庭对睡眠重要性的认识。 加强教育工作者与政策制定者之间的合作也是解决睡眠健康不平等的重要途径。教育工作者在日常工作中直接接触儿童，能够及时发现他们的睡眠问题并提供支持。政策制定者则应为教育工作者提供必要的培训和资源，帮助他们识别影响儿童睡眠健康的社会文化因素。通过建立跨部门的合作机制，促进教育、医疗和社区服务的协同作用，可以更全面地应对儿童睡眠健康问题。一些学校已经开始与社区卫生服务机构合作，为有睡眠问题的学生提供转介服务和支持。 展望未来，研究方向的多样性将是推动儿童睡眠健康改善的关键。需要更多的跨学科研究来深入理解儿童睡眠健康的复杂性，包括心理学、社会学和公共卫生等领域的交叉研究。这些研究不仅有助于揭示儿童睡眠健康不平等的根源，还能为制定更加有效的政策提供理论支持。例如，可以进一步探讨特定社会文化因素对儿童睡眠的具体影响机制，以及不同干预措施的有效性。同时，关注儿童睡眠健康的长期追踪研究，了解童年时期的睡眠模式对青少年和成年时期健康的影响，也具有重要意义。 总之，解决儿童睡眠健康不平等问题需要多方合作和综合措施。只有通过改善社区环境、提高医疗保健可及性以及加强各方合作，才能确保每一个儿童都能享有健康的睡眠。未来的研究也将为这一领域的发展提供新的视角和解决方案，助力实现儿童睡眠健康的公平与平等。让我们共同努力，为每一个孩子创造一个更健康、更美好的未来。 参考资料： - MSU Study Reveals Sleep Variability Among

“熊猫眼”（也就是黑眼圈）、白天感到疲劳、皮肤干燥等，重者则会使人的免疫力下降、肝功能异常、出现慢性疾病等。如今，一项来自美国密歇根大学学术医学中心的最新研究发现，长期不规律睡眠、晚上熬夜、晚上睡眠时间较少，甚至可能会增加一个人患抑郁症的风险。相关研究论文以 “ Day-to-day variability in sleep parameters and depression risk: a prospective cohort study of training physicians ” 为题，于近日发表在科学期刊 NPJ Digital Medicine 上。 阅读链接： 熬夜一时爽，但也会让你第二天情绪变糟！最新研究：熬夜或让你抑郁 7，JAMA Netw Open：失眠吗？那就打打太极拳 来源：梅斯神经 据数据显示，全球超过50%的老年人有睡眠障碍，其中失眠率高达20％至40％。太极拳是一种有益于身心健康的运动，研究显示可改善睡眠质量。虽然主观数据对评价失眠治疗反应很有价值，但安慰剂效应可能会影响数据的可靠性。因此，要准确评价太极拳对失眠治疗效果，必须包括主观和客观测量。近日，发表在JAMA Netw Open杂志的一项研究显示，太极拳干预与传统运动方法类似，均可改善失眠，且有益效果持续了24个月。太极拳可以作为失眠的一种替代方法。 阅读链接： JAMA Netw Open：失眠吗？那就打打太极拳 8，Aging：睡眠时间≤5小时，痴呆症的发生风险增加45% 睡眠特征与痴呆症之间的关系 睡眠障碍对身体健康危害极大，包括心血管疾病，代谢性疾病，中风以及老年痴呆等等。然而，睡眠障碍和睡眠不足在老年人中很常见，并与痴呆的发生发展和全因死亡率有关。 为了研究睡眠障碍和睡眠不足与痴呆和死亡风险之间的联系，近日，来自布莱根妇女医院的研究人员进行了一项新的研究，该研究收纳了来自《美国国家健康与衰老趋势研究》（NHATS）65岁及65岁以的2812名参与人员，调查了有关参与者的结局信息，比如痴呆的发生以及死亡原因等。结果发现，睡眠障碍和睡眠不足与痴呆症之间存在着密切的关系。与每晚睡眠7-8小时相比，睡眠时间≤5小时和入睡时间> 30分钟的参与者痴呆症的发生风险增加45%， 阅读链接： Aging：睡眠时间≤5小时，痴呆症的发生风险增加45% 9，睡一觉，容易把不好的情绪记下来 密歇根大学的研究人员一直在研究与特定感觉事件相关的记忆是如何在小鼠身上形成和储存的。研究人员在先前的研究中发现，被视觉刺激激活的神经元不仅在随后的睡眠中保持更活跃，睡眠对它们将恐惧记忆与感觉事件联系起来的能力至关重要。目前尚不清楚的是，睡眠中记忆的这种“重新激活”是否需要发生，以便充分储存新学习材料的记忆。 近日，研究人员发现，当他们激活神经元，并将这种激活与轻微的足部电击配对时，受试者随后会害怕视觉刺激，这些刺激看起来与这些细胞编码的图像相似。反过来也是正确的：在将视觉刺激与足部电击配对后，受试者随后会对重新激活神经元产生恐惧反应。研究结果表明感觉皮层区域必须与其他大脑结构沟通，将记忆的感觉方面与情感方面结合起来。 阅读链接： 睡一觉，容易把不好的情绪记下来 10，“打工人”熬夜的危害又来了：工作欠佳、因残疾而提前“退休”的风险更高 三种睡眠表型的男性和女性分别在有关 “工作表现” 问卷中获得的分数 日前学术头条就曾报道了一项 “熬夜可能导致抑郁”的研究，揭示了熬夜对人们情绪的消极影响。文中还提到，新入职的医生们由于睡眠时间短、经常熬夜，具有很高的抑郁症患病风险。现在，一项有关熬夜危害的最新研究又来了...... 这次 “中招” 的，可是全体打工人。 近日，一项在线发表于 Occupational & Environmental Medicine 杂志上的研究发现，“夜猫子” 工作表现不佳的可能性是“早起鸟” 的两倍，并且他们因残疾而导致提前退休的风险更高。在此次研究中发现，在晚睡的男性（28％）和女性（24％）中，大约有四分之一的人在 46 岁时工作表现欠佳，这一比例明显高于清晨表型和中立表型。而且无论男女，夜猫子们工作表现不佳的几率是早起者的两倍，工作表现不佳与领取残疾抚恤金的风险增加密切相关，男性熬夜者因残疾而提前退休的可能性是早起者的三倍。 阅读链接： “打工人”熬夜的危害又来了：工作欠佳、因残疾而提前“退休”的风险更高 11，《意识与认知》——梦在整晚睡眠中如何随时间变化? 特定睡眠阶段对认知过程的贡献越来越多。非快速眼动睡眠尤其与发作性记忆巩固有关，而快速眼动睡眠优先巩固和调节情绪信息，并产生创造力和洞察力。梦的内容反映了这些过程：非快速眼动梦更像是情景记忆，而快速眼动梦则更具有情感性和奇异性。伦敦大学一项新的研究着眼于梦境内容与夜间不同时间的关系，研究结果于近日发表在《意识与认知》杂志。 在最近的这项研究中，研究人员希望观察梦境的内容是否也根据夜晚的时间而改变，这可能反映了整个睡眠过程中睡眠功能随时间变化的过程。研究结果表明，梦的内容会随着睡眠时间的变化而变化。通常，每晚睡眠的前半段所做的梦与醒着的生活更相关（或持续），夜晚的后半段包含的梦境内容更加个人化，更情绪化，更贴近遥远的过去。 阅读链接： 《意识与认知》——梦在整晚睡眠中如何随时间变化? 12，【新研究】睡眠的好处！最新研究发现良好的睡眠反过来对创伤性脑损伤有治疗作用 此前有研究表明创伤性脑损伤后患者会出现慢性睡眠紊乱。近日，一项新的军事研究表明，良好的睡眠反过来对创伤性脑损伤有治疗作用。该研究发表在Journal of Neurotrauma 期刊上，研究使用了俄勒冈健康与科学大学开发的一种磁共振成像新技术，该研究旨在确定脑损伤对美国退伍军人的脑血管周围间隙（PVS）负担的影响，以及睡眠是否能调节这种影响？ 研究人员评估了大脑周围血管间隙的扩大，并发现与痴呆症的发展有关。研究表明中睡眠不好的退伍军人的脑血管周围间隙扩大和脑震荡症状更加严重，睡眠在脑外伤后清除大脑废物中起着重要作用；如果睡眠不好，大脑可能无法有效清除废物。这项研究是不断增长的最新研究，着重强调睡眠对大脑健康的重要性。 阅读链接： 【新研究】睡眠的好处！最新研究发现良好的睡眠反过来对创伤性脑损伤有治疗作用 13，J Ethnopharmacol：Ashwagandha根提取物可以提高睡眠质量，有助于管理失眠 睡眠是人类健康中最重要的生理方面之一，有助于能量的循环、活力和恢复活力。失眠已成为最常见的睡眠障碍，发病率很高，严重影响患者的生活质量和认知功能。长期以来，Ashwagandha因其诱导睡眠的作用而闻名，可作为治疗失眠症的替代方案。 近日，一项随机、平行组、分层设计、安慰剂对照研究评价了Ashwagandha根提取物对健康受试者和失眠受试者睡眠的药理作用，发现Ashwagandha根提取物可以提高睡眠质量并有助于管理失眠，结果已于近日发表于 J Ethnopharmacol 上。 阅读链接： J Ethnopharmacol：Ashwagandha根提取物可以提高睡眠质量，有助于管理失眠 14，研究发现：闻着伴侣的气味入睡，能提高睡眠质量 睡眠程序时间表 优质睡眠，是每一个人所期待的，可是，对于某些人来说简直就是可遇不可求的“奢侈品”。优质睡眠，不仅仅取决于“睡眠时间长短”，更取决于“睡眠质量”！如果没有睡眠质量，睡得时间再长也会感觉到“一夜无眠”、终日疲惫不堪。日前，不列颠哥伦比亚大学心理学系研究人员在 Psychological Science 期刊发表了一篇研究，研究表明，当人们能够闻到伴侣的气味入睡时，睡眠质量将会得到提高。 在该研究中，研究人员邀请了115名受试者，每名受试者被发放两件相同的T恤，一件是伴侣穿过的，一件是由陌生人穿过或是干净的。同时受试者需要佩戴仪器，以监测睡眠情况。研究人员发现，那些被分配了伴侣穿过的T恤受试者中，70%睡眠质量有所提高，平均每晚额外睡眠超过9分钟。 阅读链接： 研究发现：闻着伴侣的气味入睡，能提高睡眠质量 15，警惕！睡眠不足、压力过大，可能出现“脑震荡” 据世界卫生组织（WHO）统计，全球睡眠障碍率达27%。而在中国，大部分“打工人”觉得自己睡眠不足。中国睡眠研究会发布的睡眠调查报告显示，在我国有睡眠障碍的人群超3亿人，其中，晚上11点后入睡的人超3/4，凌晨1点以后才能入睡的人占近1/3。 近日，由美国俄亥俄州立大学的研究团队调查了30587名名大学生运动员，在没有近期脑震荡的情况下，11％-27％的大学生患有脑震荡后综合征（PCS），导致PCS的3个主要因素是：睡眠不足、既往精神健康问题和压力。该项研究结果发表在Sports Medicine上。 阅读链接： 警惕！睡眠不足、压力过大，可能出现“脑震荡” 16，经济越发达，更容易失眠？ 睡眠质量是由性别、工作和家庭需求来决定。澳大利亚墨尔本大学研究人员于近日在PLOS ONE上发表了一项研究。研究人员分析了2012年里欧洲29个国家27，616名25~64岁的就业人员的数据，发现在两性发展较高的国家，员工更有可能报告说睡得安稳。无论男女，管理人员的睡眠质量可能比非管理人员差一些；GDP较高的国家，男性管理人员的睡眠质量较好。对于非管理者的男女而言，经济越发达，他们的失眠频率略高，管理者正好相反--他们的睡眠随着经济增长而改善，男性管理者尤为明显。 比起女性，男性的睡眠似乎更容易受到工作时间的影响。经济增长因素对睡眠质量的改善相当有限，只对男性管理者的睡眠获益。而较高的两性发展水平可能改善男性和女性睡眠质量。性别平等还可以改善女性管理者的睡眠，减少女性员工更高地位的压力，这项研究结果有助于缩小两性之间的发展差距提供一些帮助。 阅读链接： 经济越发达，更容易失眠？ 17，AJP：后期被诊断为孤独症谱系障碍的婴儿的入睡问题和与其相关的亚皮质发育 来源：思影科技 在生命最开始的12个月里，我们把大部分时间都花在了睡眠上，而这一阶段被认为是大脑发育成熟的关键时期。研究表明，孤独症谱系障碍（Autism spectrum disorder，ASD）儿童入睡或睡眠维持困难问题的发生概率是正常发育儿童的2-3倍。睡眠不足对于孤独症儿童的认知发育，行为以及家庭功能的影响是显而易见的。然而，以往并没有研究探讨过睡眠不佳对孤独症儿童脑发育的影响。另外，由于大量文献发现孤独症个体存在亚皮质（subcortical）区域体积变化，而亚皮质区域也被发现与睡眠问题相关。 基于此，研究人员使用队列研究方法，对存在孤独症高家族风险或低家族风险的婴儿从6月龄到24月龄的睡眠模式改变以及其与大脑亚皮质体积发育的关系进行深入探讨。研究结果发现后期被诊断为孤独症的婴儿中，睡眠问题在他们6-12月龄时更为普遍；并且，仅在后期诊断为孤独症的高风险婴儿中发现他们的入睡问题与海马的体积发育有关。该研究于近日发表在The American Journal of Psychiatry 杂志。 阅读链接： AJP：后期被诊断为孤独症谱系障碍的婴儿的入睡问题和与其相关的亚皮质发育 18，哈佛大学研究证实：睡得少，死得早 现代社会，每天的工作、学习和生活都令我们压力山大，这些压力带给我们最显著的问题之一就是睡眠不足，睡眠障碍和缺乏症在老年人中更加常见，并且有研究表明，睡眠障碍和缺乏与痴呆症和全因死亡率风险有关。近日，哈佛大学医学院睡眠医学科、哈佛大学医学院附属布列根和妇女医院的研究人员在 Aging 期刊发表了一项研究论文。 这项前瞻性研究表明，睡眠障碍和睡眠不足，与痴呆症和全因死亡风险增加有关，那些每天睡眠时间不足5小时者，患痴呆症和全因死亡风险增加了一倍以上。这项研究结果阐明了睡眠不足、睡眠质量差与痴呆症和死亡风险之间的联系，为睡眠对大脑健康的重要性增添了新的证据，也提示了改善睡眠和治疗睡眠障碍可能是治疗阿尔茨海默症和降低死亡风险的潜在手段。 阅读链接： 哈佛大学研究证实：睡得少，死得早 19，Sleep：睡觉打鼾增加痴呆风险，及时治疗可降低风险 打鼾是生活中一种比较常见的现象，但大家并未认为这是一种疾病，而只是觉得这是一种不好的睡眠习惯。但事实上，打鼾是由于身体的某些机能异常引起的，是一种不该被忽视的疾病，临床上专业名称是阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征（OSAS）。 近日，美国密歇根大学睡眠障碍中心的研究人员在 Sleep 期刊发表了研究论文。研究团队分析了超过全国范围内超过50000名被诊断患有阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征的65岁以上人群，发现那些使用气道正压通气治疗的患者与未使该疗法的人相比，在接下来的三年中发展为痴呆症的概率更低。这些发现也强调了睡眠对于认知功能的影响。阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征的诊断和有效治疗，可能对老年人的认知健康起着关键作用。 阅读链接： Sleep：睡觉打鼾增加痴呆风险，及时治疗可降低风险 20，近日，加州大学发现睡眠的本质，开辟睡眠障碍治疗新途径！ 虽然我们一生中三分之一的时间都在做睡觉这件事，但我们对睡眠的作用机理仍然知之甚少。几十年来，科学家们一直通过观察大脑神经元的行为来了解睡眠的本质。然而现在，加州大学旧金山分校的研究人员已经证实，另一种类型的脑细胞——星形胶质细胞，可以影响动物睡眠的时长和深度。 这一发现可能为探索睡眠障碍治疗开辟新的途径，并帮助科学家更好地了解与睡眠障碍有关的大脑疾病，如阿尔茨海默氏症和其他痴呆症。该研究成果于日前发表在eLife 上。 阅读链接： 近日，加州大学发现睡眠的本质，开辟睡眠障碍治疗新途径！ 21，记忆与睡眠：睡眠认知如何让清醒的头脑变得更好 在慢波睡眠中，陈述性记忆的巩固涉及到多个大脑区域和神经元之间的相互作用 我们保留的记忆可以起到很多作用。它们指导我们未来的行动，形成构建自我的脚手架，并继续塑造自我和我们感知世界的方式。虽然我们每天获得的大部分记忆都会被遗忘，但那些整合在多个先前记忆结构中的记忆往往会持久存在。越来越多的研究正在阐明记忆的巩固是如何依赖于睡眠期间记忆的重新激活的。在睡眠中处理记忆不仅有助于抵消记忆的减弱，还有助于解决问题、创造力和情绪调节。 然而，基于睡眠的处理过程也有不好之处，比如忧虑被过度重提。因此，关于记忆和睡眠的研究进展可以阐明这一过程是如何影响我们清醒的生活的，这可以进一步激励人们开发新的策略，减少睡眠中有害的沉思类活动，促进有益的睡眠认知。该研究成果发表在Annual Review of Psychology 杂志。 阅读链接： 记忆与睡眠：睡眠认知如何让清醒的头脑变得更好 22，「扰人清梦，如谋财害命」EHJ (IF=22) 报道中断睡眠会缩短寿命，女性尤甚 先前的研究表明了睡眠时间过短或过长都与死于心血管疾病或其他原因的风险增加有关。然而，直到现在，人们还不知道在夜间睡眠中唤醒负担 (唤醒次数和持续时间的组合) 是否也与死亡风险有关，唤醒负担 (AB) 在心血管相关疾病和全因死亡率的详细临床意义仍然未知。 近日，来自澳大利亚阿德莱德大学电气和电子工程学院等单位的研究团队在 European Heart Journal (IF = 22.67) 在线发表了文章，该研究首次利用大规模的人群队列，揭示了夜间睡眠时无意识清醒的频率和持续时间与死于心血管疾病以及其他任何原因的风险增加之间存在明确的关联，并且这种相关性对于女性来说更高。 阅读链接： 「扰人清梦，如谋财害命」EHJ (IF=22) 报道中断睡眠会缩短寿命，女性尤甚 23，有轮班工作睡眠障碍的司机发生车祸的可能性是普通人的3倍 来源：梅斯医学 上夜间轮班的人比上白班的人更容易患上慢性病，即轮班工作睡眠障碍。睡眠障碍以及各种急性和慢性医学状况会影响个人睡眠的质量和数量，从而导致白天过度嗜睡。先前的研究表明，睡眠障碍会增加交通事故的风险，但其中大多数研究是在受控环境中进行的，例如实验室驾驶模拟器。但是现在还没有真实数据的研究。 近日，一项由苏里大学的研究人员发表在上的研究使用了来自美国六个州约2,000个事件的实际观察到的撞车事故数据，发现睡眠障碍会增加撞车事故风险。研究结果表明轮班工作睡眠障碍的人发生车祸的可能性也要高出三倍。该研究结果发表在Science Direct 上。 阅读链接： 有轮班工作睡眠障碍的司机发生车祸的可能性是普通人的3倍 24，北方人易胖，南方人睡眠差 | 清华大学发布中国健康地图 健康行为指数生活习惯——总体评价结果统计图 近日，清华大学发布《清华城市健康行为指数》，该报告基于2019年数据，对全国80个主要城市的居民进行调研，覆盖27个省、5.5亿人。报告显示，我国城市健康行为指数总体水平较好，中等水平及以上城市数量占比高达78%。 在城市排名中，杭州位列第一，上海、深圳、宜昌、温州居于前五。排名位于优秀和良好级别的城市，主要分布于东部沿海和长江经济带，呈现出“弓箭型”分布。北方城市肥胖人群比重明显高于南方城市，南方城市居民睡眠不良问题较严重。云贵地区烟民众多，15岁以上人群吸烟率达到30%-40%。从总体评价结果来看，南方城市居民的生活习惯指数整体优于北方城市。 阅读链接： 北方人易胖，南方人睡眠差 |

当前，许多青少年将观看各种电子媒体作为他们最喜欢的休闲方式。但是，你有没有发现，在长时间玩手机后有时更难入睡了？有人将其中的原因归结为手机或者一些电子产品的屏幕产生的蓝光。为此，现在大多数智能手机都具有夜间模式功能，就是为了减少蓝光发射和眼睛疲劳，帮助用户更好地睡眠。但是，手机的夜间模式真的有助于睡眠吗？最新科学研究表明，事实可能并非如此。 近日，来自美国杨百翰大学的一项新研究挑战了手机制造商的这种“言论”，并发现手机夜间模式实际上并不能改善睡眠。实验结果显示，开启手机夜间模式、禁用手机夜间模式和不使用手机的受试者在睡眠潜伏期、睡眠质量、睡眠持续时间和 WASO 指标上没有明显差异。该研究结果发表在科学期刊 Sleep Health 上。 阅读链接： 手机夜间模式有助于睡眠？最新研究揭示：或许并非如此 26，美国医生谈失眠：患者可能并不需要「睡觉药」| ACP2021 近日召开的美国内科医师学会（ACP）内科医学线上年会中，睡眠医学领域专家、美国约翰斯·霍普金斯大学医学院Christopher Lettieri教授指出，慢性失眠在基层经常被漏诊，人们对它也常常存在误解。 Lettieri教授认为，目前慢性失眠的治疗存在过度用药的现象，而长期用药可能导致恶性循环。然而，除非配合行为干预，否则这些药物并不能真正帮助患者解决睡眠问题。并且，这些药物本身也有副作用换言之，处方药治疗的仅仅是失眠症状，而不是失眠本身。让患者真正准备好睡觉再上床，而不是在床上辗转反侧，对患者其实更好。 阅读链接： 美国医生谈失眠：患者可能并不需要「睡觉药」| ACP2021 27，梦游者患帕金森病风险比常人高出4倍！ 睡眠行为障碍对帕金森病的影响 PD患者常出现运动障碍，但也会观察到一些非运动性特征，这可能与进行性神经变性相关。识别非运动症状对于理解PD疾病的病理学和临床意义至关重要。快速眼动睡眠行为障碍（RBD）是PD的研究最广泛的非运动功能之一。先前有研究显示，除了RBD之外，特别是梦游，与PD的严重程度相关。 近日，发表在JAMA Netw Open 杂志的一项研究显示，梦游或患有RBD的男性患PD风险可能更高。与没有梦游或者RBD的男性相比，梦游者或患有RBD的男性患PD风险高出4倍以上。 阅读链接： 梦游者患帕金森病风险比常人高出4倍！ 28，还是“朝九晚五”好昼夜颠倒可能会让男性的免疫系统过度反应，更易发生感染... 昼夜颠倒的作息时间会扰乱人体昼夜节律（生物钟），导致睡眠-唤醒周期和进食模式出现紊乱，这可能会带来很严重的健康问题。近日，发表在PLOS Computational Biology 上的一项研究中，来自加拿大滑铁卢大学的研究人员模拟了生物钟和免疫系统之间的相互作用，阐明了不规律的作息时间与免疫系统受损有关，进而影响了身体抵抗感染的能力。而且，这种影响还存在性别差异。 阅读链接： 还是“朝九晚五”好昼夜颠倒可能会让男性的免疫系统过度反应，更易发生感染... 29，【Nature子刊】原来不好好睡觉真的会变笨！睡觉时，你知道你的记忆在干嘛吗？ 小时候，贪玩不睡觉时，妈妈总是吓唬我：“再不睡觉，你就会变笨奥”。近日，英国伯明翰大学和慕尼黑分校的研究人员在 Nature Communications 发表了关于睡眠对记忆影响的新研究。 研究显示，当我们睡觉时，大脑会产生特定的激活模式，重新激活越强，我们对过去事件的回忆就越清楚。这些结果为人类睡眠的记忆功能提供了新观点，并强调睡眠节律对于增强我们的回忆能力和编排记忆创造方面的重要性。 阅读链接： 【Nature子刊】原来不好好睡觉真的会变笨！睡觉时，你知道你的记忆在干嘛吗？ 30，成人慢性失眠怎么治？看看AASM最新指南 近日，《成人慢性失眠的行为和心理治疗：美国睡眠协会临床实践指南》确立了成人慢性失眠障碍使用行为和心理治疗的临床实践推荐。本版指南共进行了6项推荐。其中只有一项推荐为“强”推荐，推荐多成分的失眠治疗的认知行为疗法（Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia,CBT-I）来治疗成人慢性失眠障碍。 阅读链接： 成人慢性失眠怎么治？看看AASM最新指南 31，美国西北大学找到果蝇深睡眠阶段的证据，发现其具有废物清除功能 “喙延长”发生在深度睡眠阶段 深度睡眠也被称作是“黄金睡眠”，研究人员在几乎每种动物中都发现了睡眠活动，包括无脊椎动物，但是目前尚不清楚无脊椎动物的睡眠功能是否与哺乳动物相似。日前，美国西北大学神经生物学系教授巴特·范·阿尔芬（Bart van Alphen）用果蝇这一无脊椎动物模型，找到了果蝇深睡眠阶段的证据，该阶段具有废物清除功能。 研究发现，喙的周期性运动（ PEs ）过程内果蝇通常不活动（腿，翅膀或梳理动作），发生在果蝇深度睡眠阶段。PEs阶段有助于果蝇恢复伤口和清理废物。苍蝇和人类似乎都具有独立进化的机制，进化出了机械解决方案，以增加睡眠期间的血流动力学振荡。该研究结果发表在Science Advances 上。 阅读链接： 美国西北大学找到果蝇深睡眠阶段的证据，发现其具有废物清除功能 38，睡眠不足有害健康，那睡眠过多呢？ 睡眠对我们的健康和福祉有重大影响。忙碌的生活方式往往使我们难以如愿以偿地睡眠。睡眠不足会影响我们的情绪、集中注意力的能力和许多医疗状况的风险。我们经常被鼓励多睡觉，但睡得太多会不会有负面影响？该研究于近日发表在ScienceAlert 上。 观察数据表明，睡眠时间远超过7小时与负面结果相关，可能有其他因素联系起了长睡眠时间与负面结果，但目前还不清楚这些因素是什么。睡眠时间不是一个定数。如果觉得困倦，那就说明自己需要睡眠。如果按平时的睡眠习惯，现在突然无法缓解困意，那表明你或许需要和医生谈谈。 阅读链接： 睡眠不足有害健康，那睡眠过多呢？ 39，失眠？可能与你是近视有关...研究发现昼夜节律紊乱与近视之间的联系 近视是最常见的儿童和年轻人屈光性视力障碍，也是导致成年后致盲的最大风险因素。许多研究已表明，包括家族史、近距离工作的增加、教育压力、社会经济地位和较少的户外活动等都与近视有关。近日，发表在 Sleep 上的一项研究中，来自澳大利亚弗林德斯大学领导的研究团队为近视背后的生物学和环境因素提供了新的见解。 该研究发现，与视力正常者相比，近视者入睡的时间更长，夜间睡眠的时间更短，而且更有可能晚睡或成为“夜猫子”。而且，这些睡眠习惯还与近视者在睡前花更多时间使用电脑或其他数码设备有关。这项研究为近视背后的生物学和环境因素提供了新的见解，这将有助于儿童近视的早期诊断和治疗。 阅读链接： 失眠？可能与你是近视有关...研究发现昼夜节律紊乱与近视之间的联系 40，神经网络学习模式启发关于做梦的假说 几十年前，心理学家大胆地解释了为什么想象力会在你我陷入梦乡时，编织出奇怪的、不受约束的剧情——普遍共识是，大脑在整理清醒时获取的信息。研究人员认为，关于我们为什么做梦，显然有大量的理论，但大家应该注意到一个重视做梦本身的理论——练习做梦，熟练做梦，就是你做梦的原因。 梦境就是大脑在提醒自己，不要从偶然事件中，寻找共同特征。尽管做梦的本质使得我们很难检验这些假说，但检验过度适应大脑假说的实验将侧重于概括能力而非记忆力。这项研究结果发表在《模式》上。 阅读链接： 神经网络学习模式启发关于做梦的假说 41，JAMA子刊：睡早起早，抑郁减少 分析早睡早起偏好与抑郁症的关系 抑郁症，又称为抑郁障碍，全球超过3亿人受抑郁症困扰。据世界卫生组织统计数据，抑郁症目前已成为世界第四大疾病。近日，哈佛大学和麻省理工学院的研究人员在 JAMA Psychiatry 期刊上发表了一篇研究论文。该研究通过分析多达85万人的基因数据表明，仅仅提前一小时入睡和起床就能将抑郁风险降23%。 阅读链接： JAMA子刊：睡早起早，抑郁减少 42，一项大规模研究：“夜猫子”更容易抑郁，主观幸福感也更低... 昼夜节律是一种普遍存在于生物体的内源性计时系统（俗称生物钟），大约以24小时为一个周期，控制着身体一系列生物过程。昼夜偏好被认为是个体昼夜节律系统的一种行为表现。个体昼夜偏好也与疾病发展有关，包括生理和心理疾病。 近日发表在 Molecular Psychiatry 上的一项最新研究中，来自英国埃克塞特大学领导的研究团队通过一项大规模研究发现了迄今为止最有力的证据：睡眠模式与自然生物钟相违背的人更容易抑郁，主观幸福感也更低。也就是说，早睡早起有助于预防抑郁症，并促进自身幸福感。研究人员认为，这可能也是这个社会更倾向于“早起的鸟儿有虫吃，”，即朝九晚五的工作模式。 阅读链接： 一项大规模研究：“夜猫子”更容易抑郁，主观幸福感也更低... 43，大规模研究表明，睡眠不足、压力给大脑带来的伤害，犹如脑震荡 工作、学习、生活中的种种带给我们最明显的问题就是睡眠不足，在中国，有超过3亿中国人存在睡眠障碍，而且这一数据还在逐年上升中。近日，美国俄亥俄州立大学的研究人员在 Sports Medicine 期刊发表了一篇研究论文。 这项针对超过3万名未经受脑震荡的健康精英运动员的调查表明，有11％至27％的人报告的症状组合符合国际疾病系统定义的脑震荡后综合征（PCS）的标准，其中最容易预测PCS症状的三个因素是：睡眠不足、既往精神健康问题和压力。这也提示了我们，睡眠不足和压力会导致出现类似PCS的症状和后果。 阅读链接： 大规模研究表明，睡眠不足、压力给大脑带来的伤害，犹如脑震荡 44，最新研究表明，咖啡因难以对抗睡眠不足，提神作用并没有想象中那么强 我们知道，咖啡、茶和功能饮料是常见的提神饮品，这是因为它们都含有一种中枢神经兴奋剂——咖啡因。咖啡因能够暂时赶走睡意并恢复精力，因此，许多睡眠不足的人都依赖于咖啡因来提升自己的精神状态。 近日，美国密歇根州立大学睡眠与学习实验室的研究人员在 Journal of Experimental Psychology : Learning, Memory, and Cognition 期刊上发表了研究论文。研究团队评估了咖啡因在抵消睡眠剥夺对认知的负面影响方面的效果。他们发现，咖啡因只能部分缓解睡眠不足带来的困倦，但在高水平难度任务中的表现仍然会受到影响，例如外科手术和驾驶。 阅读链接： 最新研究表明，咖啡因难以对抗睡眠不足，提神作用并没有想象中那么强 45，想睡个好觉吗？那就睡前别听音乐，催眠曲也不行... 当一首歌曲或旋律（尤其是脍炙人口的）被重复播放时，往往人就会像被洗脑了一样在脑海里不断重复这首歌（或旋律），挥之不去，甚至还会不自觉的哼唱，这就叫做“耳虫效应”。耳虫（earworm）是一种无意识（不由自主）的音乐想象。研究人员把“耳虫” 引起的这种感觉称作“认知瘙痒”。近日，发表在Psychological Science 上的一项最新研究中，Scullin与合作者调查了听音乐是否会影响睡眠，并深入了解了“耳虫效应”的发生机制。 研究发现经历“耳虫效应”的人更难入睡，夜间醒来的次数更多，在浅睡眠阶段花费的时间更长。令人惊讶的是，该研究发现一些器乐音乐（无人声）比抒情歌曲更容易导致耳虫效应和破坏睡眠质量。这一结果与音乐作为一种助眠“疗法”的想法相反，即使在音乐停止播放几小时后，大脑依然在处理音乐。 阅读链接： 想睡个好觉吗？那就睡前别听音乐，催眠曲也不行... 46，Research Articles导读｜时差对于脑白质功能的影响 我们在乘坐飞机到国外旅行时，由于时差的变化，会引起人昼夜节律紊乱，导致睡眠-觉醒障碍，医学上叫做“时差综合症”。短期内的一次跨时区飞行引起的时差症状常伴有睡眠剥夺，通常需要8天或者更长的时间人体的生理功能才能适应这种变化。由于睡眠-觉醒问题与大脑功能息息相关，因此研究其神经机理就显得尤为重要，可以根据脑功能的变化特征做出适当应对策略，缓解时差导致的症状。 近日发表在《精神影像学》上的一篇研究表明，扣带回相关白质功能网络连接改变与时差引起的正性情绪减低显著相关。该研究首次对时差引起的白质功能改变进行系统研究，为白质功能网络在认知神经科学和临床神经精神病学中应用的又一例证。 阅读链接： Research Articles导读｜时差对于脑白质功能的影响 47，连续三天睡眠时间少于6小时会怎样？足以让身心健康恶化... 每晚睡眠时间均少于建议的6小时被称为习惯性睡眠不足，它与个体心理健康、认知可塑性、专注力和生理健康呈负相关。然而不幸的是，习惯性睡眠不足在成年人群中已变得非常普遍。近日发表在 Annals of Behavioral Medicine 上的一项新研究中，来自美国南佛罗里达大学衰老研究学院助理教授Soomi Lee研究了参与者连续多个晚上睡眠时间少于6小时的后果。 研究发现只需要连续三个晚上的睡眠不足，就足以导致人的精神和身体健康状况出现严重恶化。该研究首次提供证据证明连续多天的睡眠不足预示着成年人日常情感和身体健康轨迹的退化。 阅读链接： 连续三天睡眠时间少于6小时会怎样？足以让身心健康恶化... 48，糖尿病+睡眠障碍=致命组合？ 近日，《睡眠研究杂志》（Journal of Sleep Research）发布了一项研究，表明有睡眠障碍的糖尿病患者全因死亡率比那些从未或很少有睡眠障碍同时未患有糖尿病的成年人高87%。 该研究纳入了英国生物银行（UK Biobank）队列中的487728名参与者数据，调查显示参与者中超过四分之一的人常有睡眠障碍，仅不到四分之一的参与者报告他们从未或很少有睡眠障碍，其余一半的受试者说他们偶尔有睡眠障碍。 阅读链接： 糖尿病+睡眠障碍=致命组合？ 49，预测白日梦和头脑空白 |《自然-通讯》论文 注意力缺失会在人们醒着的时候发生，这与心智游移（mind wandering，即白日梦）或大脑空白有关，在此过程中意识流发生了中止。这些注意力缺失在人们疲倦时发生更频繁，可能与一种称为“局部睡眠”的神经现象有关，其中特定脑区表现出进入慢波睡眠的迹象，而剩下的脑区则保持警醒。为此，法国脑与脊柱研究所巴黎脑科学院-ICM的研究人员在《自然-通讯》发表了一项研究。 “慢波”——一种神经活动，通常与过渡到睡眠相关的神经活动模式——能预测某人是否会做白日梦或出现头脑空白，以及他们对环境的反应。研究发现前脑区域的慢波先于白日梦和冲动行为出现，而当慢波发生在大脑更后面的区域如顶叶时，会继之以头脑空白和慢反应。作者认为，这是不同脑区在不同意识状态前产生的共同神经特征。 阅读链接： 预测白日梦和头脑空白 |《自然-通讯》论文

睡眠是极为重要的生理过程。近年来，基于神经调控如经颅磁刺激（TMS）技术的脑功能测量由于其无创、精准、实时测量等特点，受到更多关注。近日，我国研究者在eLife杂志发表研究成果，揭示了“困倦”的神经测量标准。研究者构建了一个基于皮层兴奋性4项TMS测量指标，发现睡眠剥夺后皮层兴奋性和抑制性突触传递均出现增强，伴随皮层兴奋性输出的适当降低，可能参与睡眠剥夺后的认知功能下降。 该研究利用新统计模型，将皮层突触传递水平改变与主观困倦程度联系起来，证实相关变化在睡眠剥夺后的产生与发展的模式；进一步为睡眠中的突触稳态理论提供了真正的人脑支持证据，构建了困倦程度的客观评价指标。 阅读链接： eLife丨“困”的神经机制与精准测量 58，PNAS：熬夜抑制性神经元活动，破坏记忆力 在当今社会，熬夜已成为许多年轻人的“新常态”，我们都知道熬夜的危害很大的，除了让人第二天精神憔悴，还损害皮肤、肝脏，甚至增加罹患心脏病和癌症的风险。近日美国密歇根大学的研究人员在PNAS 发表了研究论文。 该研究发现，当熬夜导致睡眠不足时，大脑中导航和处理及存储新记忆的海马体中的抑制神经元活动会增加。这些抑制性神经元会限制了它们周围神经元的活动，使得海马体中的正常神经元活动无法聚集，从而破坏记忆巩固。这项研究为进一步研究操纵兴奋性和抑制性神经元活动之间的相对平衡如何影响记忆和睡眠打开了新的大门。 阅读链接： PNAS：熬夜抑制性神经元活动，破坏记忆力 59，最新研究显示，新妈妈睡眠不足，加速衰老 睡眠是人体的一种修复过程，可以恢复精神和解除疲劳。然而有超过3亿中国人存在睡眠障碍，而且这一数据还在逐年上升中。近年来，高质量的睡眠对不少普通民众来说似乎都成了奢侈，对于产后新妈妈来说，照顾新生儿难免会熬夜，有了小宝宝，什么都不缺，唯一缺的就是睡眠。 近日，美国加州大学洛杉矶分校的研究人员在Sleep Health 期刊上发表了一篇研究论文。该研究通过分析女性血液样本中的DNA端粒显示，在分娩一年后，婴儿六个月大时每晚睡眠不足七小时的新妈妈的表观遗传年龄，要比睡眠大于七小时的新妈妈大3-7岁。换言之，新妈妈睡不好，直接导致她们“减寿”3-7年！ 阅读链接： 最新研究显示，新妈妈睡眠不足，加速衰老 60，薛蓉教授团队SLEEP发文！发现特发性快速眼动睡眠行为障碍患者的认知和运动功能下降与皮层下核团铁沉积增加有关 铁代谢异常是α-突触核蛋白病研究的热点问题，铁过载可导致神经功能障碍，MRI黑质背外侧高信号（N1征）缺失是反映PD患者病理改变的影像学标志之一，特发性快速眼动睡眠行为障碍（iRBD）作为α-突触核蛋白病的前驱期标志，是否存在N1征缺失及皮层下核团脑铁含量和体积异常？皮层下核团脑铁含量是否与iRBD患者的认知和运动功能受损相关？ 近日，天津医科大学总医院神经内科薛蓉课题组与天津市第一中心医院影像科夏爽团队合作，在SLEEP 杂志发表了研究论文。该研究以明确iRBD患者MRI N1征缺失比例，定量评价iRBD患者皮层下核团脑铁含量和体积，进一步探索皮层下核团脑铁含量与iRBD患者的认知和运动功能受损的关系。发现iRBD患者N1征缺失比例增高，右侧尾状核体积减少，iRBD患者的认知和运动功能下降与皮层下核团铁沉积增加有关。

阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（OSA）是一种常见的睡眠障碍，患者主要表现为睡眠时反复发作的打鼾、低通气甚至暂时性呼吸暂停而憋醒。阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停不仅会降低血液中的含氧量，导致过度疲劳、低氧血症和高碳酸血症；如果不及时治疗，还会引发一系列严重并发症， 近日，一项由哈佛医学院布莱根妇女医院等机构研究人员发表在European Respiratory Journal 的研究，为人们如何降低阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停风险提供了方法。该研究发现，增加运动，减少久坐时间，与阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停风险显著降低相关。研究建议遵循世界卫生组织现行的身体活动指南，每周至少进行150分钟的中等强度运动，并且每天坐着看电视的时间少于4小时，将大大降低患阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停的风险。 阅读链接： 少坐多动，睡得更好！阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停风险有望减少50%以上！ 61，晚上熬夜，白天小睡，并不能缓解睡眠不足带来的认知伤害 许多研究表明，睡眠不足会导致认知缺陷，许多晚上睡眠不足的人，会选择在白天小睡，试图弥补前一天晚上睡眠不足的伤害，这种白天小睡会减轻睡眠不足导致的认知缺陷吗？ 近日，美国匹茨堡大学和密歇根州立大学的研究人员在 Sleep 期刊发表了研究论文。这项最新研究表明，晚上熬夜，白天小睡并没有减轻睡眠剥夺带来的认知伤害。这些结果强调了睡眠的重要性，提醒了我们晚上熬夜，试图通过白天小睡的方式来弥补，实际上并不可行。 阅读链接： 晚上熬夜，白天小睡，并不能缓解睡眠不足带来的认知伤害 62，Nature | 睡眠影响代谢？科学家揭示大脑活动调节葡萄糖代谢新机制 光遗传实验策略 海马是参与认知活动最重要的脑区之一，同时它也参与机体内分泌调节。尖波涟漪（Sharp wave ripples，SPW-Rs）是海马在慢波睡眠过程中所呈现的一种场电位形式，主要发生在非快速眼动睡眠期，是认知活动的生物学标志。而海马对机体内分泌和荷尔蒙系统的调控主要通过影响下丘脑中分泌激素的神经元来实现的。因此，人们普遍认为海马所参与的认知活动与内分泌调控之间是相互独立没有任何关系的。 近日来自美国纽约大学的György Buzsáki团队在Nature 杂志在线发表研究论文，揭示了看似无关又相互独立的认知能力和机体代谢功能之间，可以通过海马尖波涟漪（SPW-Rs）连接起来。该研究证实海马SPW-Rs可以调节外周葡萄糖代谢。因此，海马SPW-Rs很可能是睡眠对葡萄糖代谢发挥调节作用的重要机制之一。该研究为阐释睡眠与机体代谢之间的关系提供了一种全新的机制，同时为大家理解二型糖尿病的发生机制开辟了新思路。 阅读连接： Nature |

失眠是最普遍的睡眠障碍之一，特别是在老年人中。它的特点是经常和长期难以入睡或维持睡眠、早醒，这与日间损伤有关。尽管失眠症的认知功能障碍可能是由于睡眠不足、碎片化睡眠，以及之后的困倦、疲劳和前一天晚上的低警觉性所引起，但失眠可能以一种更严重且长期的方式损害着大脑。近日Alzheimer's & Dementia 期刊上发表了文章。 研究人员评估了失眠症状的严重程度是否与认知功能相关，以及这种关系是否被阿尔茨海默病风险相关的生物标志物所修饰。另外，作者还探讨了失眠症状与自我报告的短习性睡眠时间和APOEε4等位基因状态的影响。研究发现失眠症状越严重，整体认知能力越差，逻辑记忆回忆的即时性和延迟性越差，尤其是当失眠症状合并睡眠时间较短时。这种情况在APOEε4等位基因携带者中尤其明显。 阅读链接： 【一起读文献】

大多数人一生中有三分之一的时间在睡觉。然而，大多数器官在睡眠期间继续工作。特别是，大脑在睡眠中高度活跃。近几年的研究表明，睡眠时间长短正在成为死亡的重要行为风险因素。近日来自亚洲的四个国家开展了相关研究，评估睡眠时间与全因和主要原因死亡率之间的性别相关性，研究结果发表在JAMA Network Open 杂志上。 总的来说，在男性和女性中，7小时的睡眠时间是与全因、心血管疾病和其他原因死亡相关的最低点，而8小时是男性的模式睡眠时间，是女性第二常见的睡眠时间。年龄是男性睡眠持续时间的修饰因素，但在女性中不是。 阅读链接： JAMA子刊：每晚睡多久能活更好？来看看来自亚洲四国的数据 68，JAMA子刊：早睡早起1小时，能大大降低抑郁症风险 据2019年世界卫生组织披露数据显示，全球有超过3.5亿人患抑郁症，且近十年来患者增速约18%。近日，美国麻省理工学院和哈佛大学Broad研究所的研究人员在JAMA Psychiatry 期刊发表了研究论文。 该研究对84万人的样本数据进行了统计分析发现，在睡眠中点（就寝时间和起床时间的中间点）每提前一个小时，患重度抑郁症的风险就会降低23%。这表明睡眠时间类型会影响患抑郁症的风险，同时他也是首批量化需要多少改变才能影响心理健康的研究之一。 阅读链接： JAMA子刊：早睡早起1小时，能大大降低抑郁症风险 69，Neuro：怎么熬夜越久，越精神？ 社会在飞速发展，人的压力也随之增大。我们知道，熬夜对身体有害，轻则白天无精神，重则引发疾病。但有的人还会越熬越精神，这是为什么？熬夜之后，大脑中的多巴胺会有所增加，但多巴胺转运体则不会受到影响。这种机制使得大脑在短期睡眠不足的情况下，保持兴奋状态，这对于生物演化的进程具有重要意义。 但这种代偿也存在相当程度地损害，熬夜打乱了人体的神经系统功能，身体器官失去了平衡点。此外，它并不会抵消由睡眠不足导致的认知能力和行为能力水平出现下降的趋势，因为认知与行为能力两方面与这种代偿强度呈负相关。 阅读链接： Neuro：怎么熬夜越久，越精神？ 70，间歇性禁食再添新功能：睡不好觉？可以试试安全的限时进食策略 “间歇性禁食”这种饮食干预手段已被证明可以实现长期减肥的效果，并延长了许多物种的寿命以及提高认知能力，包括在啮齿类动物、灵长类动物以及人类的衰老过程中引起广泛的健康改善。间歇性禁食策略中最为常见的形式是限时进食，即把一天的热量摄入时间窗限制在12小时以内。 近日，发表在内分泌学会杂志Endocrine Reviews 上的一篇手稿中（即将正式发表），Panda教授团队发现，除了帮助人们更好地控制体重、糖尿病和心脏病等疾病外，间歇性禁食还有助于改善整体睡眠质量。在这项新研究中，研究人员介绍了昼夜节律、昼夜节律紊乱和限时进食的概念，并回顾了有关限时进食潜在机制的研究以及最近的人类研究，并提出了一些未来将限时饮食转化为预防和管理代谢疾病手段的观点。 阅读链接：

由于睡眠和AD的风险随着年龄的增长而变化，因此需要进一步了解睡眠和认知之间的关系如何随时间而变化。近期，来自华盛顿大学医学院神经病学系的专家假设认知功能的纵向变化将与总的睡眠时间、非快速眼动睡眠（NREM）和快速眼动睡眠（REM）的时间、睡眠效率和非快速眼动慢波活动有非线性关系，结果发表在Brain 杂志上。 研究发现睡眠时间单独就足以影响大脑认知能力的变化——在7-8小时睡眠时长时认知受损风险最低。非快速眼动睡眠和快速眼动睡眠时间以及<1Hz慢波活动的中间范围内，认知功能随着时间的推移而稳定，这表明某些水平的睡眠对维持认知功能很重要。 阅读链接： Brain：一天睡10个小时还是精神不振？你可能需要提升睡眠效率！ 77，睡觉也在学习！难怪婴儿学东西速度飞快 fMRI扫描显示，相比普通词汇，睡着幼儿听到学过单词与左侧海马体（绿色）和左前（MTL）的激活呈正相关 人类记忆特定事件的能力通常出现在婴儿期，并在2-3岁时进步飞快，尤其是语言技能的学习与记忆，然而人们对早期记忆功能的神经基础却知之甚少。位于颞叶內侧（MTL）的海马体在大脑学习中扮演着重要的角色，是形成记忆和储存记忆必不可缺的一部分。 近日，加州大学戴维斯分校（University of California-Davis）的研究人员首次观察到，2岁宝宝在睡觉时听到学过单词时，大脑的特定区域是如何激活的。这些发现为探索幼儿早期记忆和单词学习的大脑机制提供了新的见解，有望帮助研究如何提升孩子早期的语言学习与记忆。该研究结果发表在Current Biology上。 阅读链接： 睡觉也在学习！难怪婴儿学东西速度飞快 78，该睡不睡，或睡眠不足时，你知道心脏在干什么吗？ 昼夜节律是一种普遍存在的内源性计时系统（生物钟），大约以24小时为一个周期。人体内几乎每个细胞都有自己的生物钟，控制机体一系列的生物过程，对我们的健康发挥着至关重要的作用。 近日，发表在Heart and Circulatory Physiology 上的一项研究显示，长期睡眠不足的健康成年人心率模式异常。当我们睡觉时，大脑会周期性地出现称为自发性皮层唤醒 (CA) 的活动高峰。参与测试的正常睡眠及短睡眠人群自发性皮层唤醒数量相似，但短睡眠组在这些事件发生后心率更高，并且与正常睡眠者相比，他们的心率恢复正常所需的时间更长。 阅读链接： 该睡不睡，或睡眠不足时，你知道心脏在干什么吗？ 79，《科学》重磅关注：印度实地探访，越贫困睡得越少 中午花上半小时打盹能在多方面改善身体素质，但代价是劳动时间会减少 人究竟为什么要睡觉？很遗憾，现在的科学家还并不完全清楚。但透过一些研究和案例，我们至少可以了解到缺乏睡眠会带来怎样的后果。实验室的研究结果显示，不充足的睡眠时间会导致认知能力衰退以及生理功能紊乱，并引发灾难式的连锁反应。近日有一群科学家在印度探索了人类在现实中面对睡眠的无奈和选择。 研究发现这些人的平均睡眠时间只有5.6小时，睡眠效率也仅为70%。许多志愿者会主动放弃睡眠来换取他们觉得更有价值的事情，比如工作、锻炼或者娱乐。研究指出，我们究竟能睡多久和个人的重视离不开，当一个人认为睡眠价值低于劳动价值时，睡眠会被动地减少。而当地对居住环境的重视和对睡眠重要性的宣传也将影响整体人群的睡眠质量。该研究发表在《科学》杂志上。 阅读链接：

多年来，医学科学一直坚信，可以通过脑电图(EEG)读数来判断一个人的睡眠深度。近日洛桑大学医院的一组研究人员的研究结果，挑战了睡眠期间脑电波缓慢表明人感觉自己处于深度睡眠状态的理论，并将研究结果发表在Current Biology上。 研究发现失眠症患者经常在他们认为自己醒着的时候睡觉，这表明他们的睡眠时间比他们想象的要多。但研究人员还发现，失眠症患者的慢波睡眠和快波睡眠存在一定程度的重叠——这表明他们同时处于清醒和睡眠状态。这一发现挑战了慢波必然表明重度睡眠和之后睡得过多的感觉的观点。 阅读链接： 这项研究对慢波睡眠最能解释深度睡眠的理论提出了挑战 85，新研究发现：睡眠不足，对大脑的伤害是毁灭性的 睡眠不足、难以入睡以及打鼾频率增加的影响 睡眠是人体的一种修复过程，可以恢复精神和解除疲劳。近年来，高质量的睡眠对不少普通民众来说似乎都成了奢侈，更令人担忧的是，睡眠问题已经不再是成年人特有的烦恼。近日，美国哈佛医学院、波士顿儿童医院的研究人员在Cerebral Cortex Communications 期刊上发表了一篇研究论文。 该研究表明，睡眠不足对发育中的青少年大脑绝对是毁灭性的伤害，并可能导致日后的记忆、注意力和情绪问题。研究分析表明，较短的睡眠时间、较长的睡眠潜伏期、频繁醒来和睡眠呼吸紊乱与低灵活性和弹性较低的大脑网络有关。网络异常可能会导致多种认知过程的缺陷，包括注意力、奖励机制、情绪调节、记忆以及计划、协调和控制行动和行为的能力。 阅读链接： 新研究发现：睡眠不足，对大脑的伤害是毁灭性的

骨代谢是由成骨细胞与破骨细胞完成的，昼夜节律失调会对成骨细胞和破骨细胞的增殖与分化产生一定影响，进而影响到骨形成和骨破坏的进程。失眠和骨折有因果关联，不管是睡太少，还是睡太多都不利于骨骼健康。 阅读链接： 西湖大学郑厚峰团队揭示，睡眠不好增加骨折风险！ 91，PNAS速递：睡眠过程中记忆的竞争动力学 睡眠中记忆模式切换的模型，展示了长时记忆和工作记忆涉及的大脑区域（主要为神经调质）和睡眠机制 记忆分为长时记忆（long term memory）和工作记忆（working memory），两者功能不同，背后的生理机制也不同。但对于大脑如何在慢波睡眠期间同时改善长时记忆和工作记忆，人们知之甚少。 近日，加州大学欧文分校的一个研究小组发现，在睡眠过程中，长时记忆和工作记忆的离线神经机制（offline neural mechanism）互不相容，也就是说大脑必须在两种记忆模式之间切换。这项发表在PNAS上的研究，首次阐明了人类大脑对两种记忆的权衡机制。 阅读连接： PNAS速递：睡眠过程中记忆的竞争动力学",

              "content": "Abstract Background/Objective: Sleep is a critically important behavior which influences diverse aspects of health, functioning, and longevity. An increasing literature suggests the importance of sleep regularity, also referred to as sleep inconsistency, sleep variability, or intraindividual variability in sleep. Given there is no brief, subjective measure of sleep regularity, the purpose of this study was to develop the Sleep Regularity Questionnaire (SRQ) and to begin the process of examining its psychometric properties using a construct-validation approach. Participants/Methods: In an online study of sleep and health, participants (n = 3249; Mage (SD) = 42.77(16.73); 48.5% female; 77.3% white) completed the in-development SRQ, as well as the Insomnia Severity Index and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: An exploratory factor analysis followed by a confirmatory factor analysis revealed a two factor structure, represented by circadian regularity and sleep continuity regularity, with good model fit indices (X2 = 50.9, df = 7, p < .001; RMSEA = .06; CFI= .99; NFI = .99; IFI = .99; TLI = .98). Test-retest reliability, as well as concurrent, convergent and incremental validity were examined, with promising results. Conclusions: Preliminary psychometrics suggest that the SRQ is a valid and stable instrument for the assessment of sleep regularity in adults that is related to, but distinct from, other established sleep constructs. Future research will benefit from assessing the validity of the SRQ in various clinical samples and how it compares to measures of sleep regularity calculated from prospective daily assessments. Keywords: Sleep Regularity, Sleep Inconsistency, Intraindividual Variability, Measurement, Self-report, Psychometrics 1. Introduction Sleep is a vital, multidimensional process critical to human functioning. While having consistent nights of sleep with adequate quality and quantity is considered a marker of healthy aging,1,2 poor sleep has been linked to adverse physical, psychological, and cognitive consequences. These adverse outcomes can, in turn, reduce overall quality of life and increase both morbidity and mortality.3 Prior research aimed at evaluating the associations between sleep and adverse outcomes has largely been conducted on the aggregate mean/average level of sleep characteristics for an individual over a period of time. Using average sleep characteristics is a generally straightforward way to classify individuals into “poor” sleepers and “good” sleepers based on their self-reported sleep quality on measures such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)4 and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)5; however, the practice of asking for aggregate retrospective recall of sleep habits, obscures the large amount of nightly inconsistency in sleep within an individual. As such, researchers could be drawing inaccurate or incomplete conclusions about the degree to which an individual’s sleep contributes to a variety of health outcomes. Even when sleep is measured prospectively via sleep diary or actigraphy, the common practice of calculating means/averages could obscure the great level of night-to-night inconsistency often present. For example, two individuals who spend, on average, 45 minutes awake per night, may have drastically different nightly sleep patterns, with one being awake very close to 45 minutes every night (Person A) and the other oscillating between around 30 minutes and 60 minutes per night (Person B; Figure 1). Sleep regularity is a comparatively new area of research in the sleep literature. Previous work has shown that many sleep characteristics were highly inconsistent, with older adults having poorer and more inconsistent sleep than younger adults.6 Specifically, older adults had more inconsistent wake after sleep onset (WASO) and sleep quality ratings.6 Lack of regularity in sleep, especially inconsistent WASO7,8 and sleep efficiency,8 has been found to be associated with poorer objective sleep quality.7,8 Similarly, lower regularity in sleep duration has been associated with subjective sleep quality and subjective well-being.9 Importantly, sleep regularity has been shown to decrease following treatment for insomnia and may serve as a marker for high treatment responsiveness.10 Lower regularity in sleep duration has been found to be associated with higher HbA1c,7 lower regularity in sleep onset was associated with higher body mass index (BMI),7 and lower regularity in a variety of sleep characteristics including bedtime, wake time, time in bed, terminal wakefulness, wake after sleep onset, sleep onset latency, and number of nighttime awakenings were associated with higher levels of pro-inflammatory markers,11,12 suggesting that sleep regularity (i.e., the opposite of sleep inconsistency) is related to other objective markers of health.7,11,12 Some associations between sleep and health, such as the association of regularity in nightly total sleep time and daytime napping with obesity,13 have been found to be independent of the association with average sleep duration, further demonstrating the importance of examining sleep regularity in addition to average sleep when looking at sleep’s role in health outcomes.14 Furthermore, preliminary evidence indicates that greater bedtime and rise time regularity in older adults is associated with sleeping more than seven hours per night.15 This finding is particularly concerning because sleeping fewer than seven hours per night is associated with greater mortality risk.16 To date, researchers have examined associations among sleep regularity and a variety of mental and physical health outcomes by utilizing subjective (i.e., diary) and objective (e.g., actigraphy) prospective daily assessments of sleep. While each of these methods are relatively easy to implement, they require intense, repeated data collection across numerous days and are not able to be rapidly scored and interpreted within a clinical setting or in large epidemiological survey designs. Therefore, there is a need for a brief subjective measure of sleep regularity. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a newly developed retrospective questionnaire, the Sleep Regularity Questionnaire (SRQ), could fill this void as a valid and reliable measure of sleep regularity and whether self-reported sleep regularity is distinct from, and adds unique information above, other commonly employed aggregate measures of self-reported sleep. Based on a theory-driven method of scale construction, we adopted a construct-validation approach17 for developing a measure that assesses the regularity of sleep. This approach involved a substantive validity phase during which the initial item pool was developed, a structural validity phase where the factor-structure was evaluated and confirmed, and an external validity phase where concurrent, convergent and incremental validity of the scale were assessed alongside theoretically supported and relevant measures. 2. Materials and Method 2.1. Participants and Procedure The present study was a secondary analysis of data from the Investigating Sleep Longitudinally Across Normal Development (ISLAND) study. Data from participants (N = 4,678) who completed sleep and health questionnaires as part of this observational online study were included in the present study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were limited to ensuring a relatively equal number of men and women living in the United States were recruited across age groups covering the adult lifespan. Enrollment was limited such that once the target had been met for a given sex/age group (~500/group), enrollment for that age/sex group was closed. The study protocol and procedures were approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Review Board (IRB# HM20008543). Participants were recruited via an online platform (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk; MTurk) where individuals are compensated for the completion of various surveys and tasks. The study did not require written informed consent; however, participants were able to view a research participant information and consent form and to agree to participate by answering “yes” to a question presented after the document had been viewed. After providing informed consent, participants completed a series of measures associated with sleep, physical health and well-being, and mental health and well-being. MTurk was identified as an appropriate data collection tool for the parent study, as MTurk tends to provide more demographically diverse samples than other standard internet data collection methods while providing the same level of reliability among data as traditional paper-and-pencil methods.18 In addition, other validated sleep measures have been demonstrated to have similar psychometric properties, whether completed online or in-person.19 To address threats to validity associated with online data collection, two validity checks were implemented as part of the survey: (a) an instructional manipulation check which asked participants to answer an item with a specific response and (b) a consistency check which compared participants’ responses to an age question at the beginning of the survey to a birthdate question at the end. Participants failing the instructional validity check (N = 587), the consistency check (N = 176), or for whom the age validity check could not be completed (i.e., both the age and birth year questions were not answered; N = 251) were excluded from analyses. Additionally, duplicate responses determined to be from the same participant were excluded from analyses and the respondent’s first response was always used (N = 380). After removal of outliers during data screening procedures (N = 35), the final sample for the study was N = 3,249. 2.2. Measures 2.2.1. Demographic Information Participants self-reported their age, gender, and race/ethnicity. 2.2.2. Sleep Regularity The Sleep Regularity Questionnaire (SRQ) was used to assess the degree to which individuals engage in consistent sleep behaviors. During the substantive validity phase measure items were developed by a licensed clinical psychologist with over a decade of experience and expertise in behavioral sleep medicine. Specific questions were built upon items from existing, validated sleep measures (i.e., daily sleep diaries, the PSQI, and the ISI) by asking about regularity of characteristics usually measured on the aggregate level. The SRQ started with questions focused on the beginning of the night (e.g., “I go to bed about the same time every night.”) and continued through to the morning (e.g., “I get out of bed at the same time each morning.”). SRQ items were selected to assess the full breadth of sleep-related behaviors. Participants rated each of the 10 items, on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) with regard to how much they agreed with each of the statements. The full SRQ is presented in Appendix A. 2.2.3. Sleep Quality Subjective sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),4 a 19-item self-report questionnaire with both Likert and open-ended response formats. Items assess average sleep patterns using the open-ended response format, e.g., “During the past month, when have you usually gone to bed?”. Items assess frequency of sleep disturbances using items such as, “During the past month, how often have you had trouble sleeping because you … Cannot get to sleep within 30 minutes?”, which are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 Not during the past month to 3 Three or more times a week. The PSQI is the most widely used measure of sleep quality and disturbances20 and will serve as a measure of convergent validity for the SRQ. 2.2.4. Insomnia Symptoms Insomnia symptoms were measured via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; e.g., “How worried/distressed are you about your current sleep pattern?”). The ISI contains seven items rated on four-point Likert scales.5 The ISI is a widely used scale which has been deemed a valid and reliable measure of insomnia symptoms among both community and clinical-based samples.5,21 The ISI was used as a measure of concurrent validity for the SRQ. 2.2.5. Depression Symptoms Depression symptoms were measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2; e.g., “Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems…Little interest or pleasure in doing things”). The PHQ-2 contains two items rated on four-point Likert scales.22 Scores on the PHQ-2 range from 0–6, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. The PHQ-2 is a widely used measure which has been deemed a valid and reliable screening measure of depression symptoms among both community and clinical-based samples.23 The PHQ-2 was used as an outcome measure to assess incremental validity of the SRQ. 2.2.6. Anxiety Symptoms Anxiety symptoms were measured via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item scale (GAD-2; e.g., “Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems…Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge”). The GAD-2 contains two items rated on four-point Likert scales.24 Scores on the GAD-2 range from 0–6, with higher scores indicating more anxiety symptoms. The GAD-2 is a widely used measure which has been deemed a valid and reliable screening measure of anxiety symptoms among both community and clinical-based samples.25 The GAD-2 was used as an outcome measure to assess incremental validity of the SRQ. 2.2.7. Physical Health Physical health was self-rated using a single item which asked, “In general, would you say your physical health is…”. Respondents answered using a 0–100 slider bar visual analog scale with five anchors (i.e., poor, fair, good, very good, excellent). Similar single-item measures of physical health have been widely used to assess individual’s perceptions of global physical health.26 Self-rated physical health was used as outcome measures to assess incremental validity of the SRQ. 2.3. Statistical Analyses 2.3.1. Data Screening Analyses were conducted using SPSS v.26 and AMOS v.26.27 The characteristics of the sample were described with counts/percentages for nominal variables and means/standard deviations for continuous variables. Patterns of missing data were assessed via Little’s MCAR test. Univariate outliers were assessed via z-scores, and multivariate outliers were assessed via Mahalanobis distance. Univariate and multivariate skewness and kurtosis coefficients as well as visual inspection of Q-Q plots were used to assess normality. The data were then split in half randomly using SPSS’s select cases function (random 50%) assigning 1640 participants to sample 1 and 1644 to sample 2. 2.3.2. Sample Size Determining sample size for factor analyses is not an exact science, but a sample size of 1000 is considered “excellent”.28 Even after dividing the sample in half to allow for split-half cross validation, each subsample contained >1000 participants and is adequately powered to determine and confirm factor structure. 2.3.3. Exploratory Factor Analysis In order to determine the factor structure of the SRQ, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) assuming no a priori factor structure was performed using principal axis factoring and a promax rotation using all 10 items of the SRQ from sample 1, a random subsample of half of the participants of the overall sample. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett’s tests were used to evaluate whether the data were suitable for factor analysis.29 Factor analysis serves several related functions in scale development, including: (1) determining the number of latent variables/factors underlying a set of items thus condensing a larger set of variables to ease understanding and interpretation, (2) determining the meaning of the factors, and (3) identifying and eliminating items that are not closely related to one of the factors. Factor analysis was employed in the present study to serve these functions. 2.3.3.1. Rotation Selection An oblique promax rotation was selected for use, as factors were expected to be related to one another.30 If factors were not found to be related at least .15–.30 or higher, an orthogonal varimax rotation would be used. 2.3.3.2. Simple Structure Several indices were used to determine the factor structure of the SRQ. First, a scree plot with the cutoff eigenvalue of 1 was utilized to visually identify the number of factors.31 An item was chosen to load onto a specific factor if the highest loading eigenvalue exceeded an absolute value of .50, with all cross loadings being at least .15 less than the item’s highest factor loading.32,33 Items not reaching these factor loading guidelines were deleted, and the EFA was rerun among retained items until a final structure was confirmed. 2.3.4. Confirmatory Factor Analysis A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on the data from sample 2 specifying the factor structures that had emerged in the EFA and omitting items not loading with simple structure in the EFA. Additional removal of multivariate outliers was performed during this step. Model fit was evaluated using previously established guidelines.30 Specifically, a goodness of fit index (GFI) of ≥ .90 was considered good, a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of ≤ .08 was considered good and ≤ .10 adequate, and a comparative fit index (CFI) normed fit index (NFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and incremental fit index (IFI) were all considered good at ≥ .95 and adequate at ≥ .90. 2.3.4.1. Measurement Invariance In order to determine whether the CFA differed between males and females, an invariance design was run as a function of gender. 2.3.4.2. Reliability and Validity Assessment Reliability via internal consistency and test-retest coefficients was investigated. Internal consistency was evaluated using item-total correlations and Cronbach’s αs for the subscale scores for the revised SRQ, and test-retest reliability of the scale was assessed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). To examine test-retest reliability, 233 individuals completed a second administration of the SRQ at an average of 78.07 days after the first assessment (range = 5–153 days, SD = 25.13 days). This group was 52.4% male, predominantly White (85%), and had a mean age of 53.85 (SD = 17.17, range = 19–89). In order to examine the scale’s concurrent and convergent validity, SRQ total scores and subscale scores were correlated with participants PSQI and ISI total scores, and were compared using t-tests between individuals categorized as ‘good’ and ‘poor’ sleepers based on PSQI and ISI. Lastly, incremental validity was ascertained via hierarchical multiple regressions, with PSQI or ISI total scores entered in the first block and one SRQ subscale score in the second block. Twelve hierarchical regressions were conducted to assess the SRQ’s ability to predict depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and self-rated physical health above and beyond the PSQI and ISI. 3. Results 3.1. Participants Demographic characteristic from the final sample are presented in Table 1. Table 1. EFA = exploratory factor analysis, CFA = confirmatory factor analysis. Note: Table represents whole sample after removal of 35 outliers from Sample 2 during CFA analyses. Sample did not significantly differ on any demographic variables. 3.2. Data Screening To assess whether data were missing completely at random (MCAR), Little’s MCAR test was used. Little’s MCAR test was found to be significant, indicating that data were missing not at random, X2(17) = 59.92, p < .001. Upon further inspection, data were only missing for PSQI total score. Therefore, no action was taken to impute the missing data, as the PSQI was selected to serve as a measure by which to validate the SRQ, and using SRQ items to impute the PSQI would falsely inflate the correlation between the scales. Instead, the participants with missing PSQI total score were excluded from that analysis only. Univariate and multivariate outliers comprised a very small amount of the total sample (< 1–2%), so these values were left in the sample.34 Structural Validity 3.3. EFA KMO (.884) and Bartlett’s (X2(45) = 2519.60, p < .001) tests were performed with results suggesting that the data were suitable for factor analysis.29 The promax rotation was maintained, as all factors were correlated at .23–.85 (all ps <.001). A scree plot31 revealed a pronounced inflection point at the second-highest eigenvalue. Specifically, the first two factors accounted for 60.32% of the items’ cumulative variance, with 50.02% explained by factor one and 10.30% explained by factor two. The item loadings for the two factors in this EFA appear in the table below. The four items that did not achieve simple structure were considered not to be a meaningful part of the factor solution and are listed at the bottom of the table (Table 2). Table 2. Items pertaining to factor one (bed time, wake time, rise time, and sleep time) may best be described as “circadian regularity”, whereas items pertaining to factor two (number of nighttime awakenings, duration of nighttime awakenings) may best be described as “sleep continuity regularity.” As factors with fewer than three items are often unstable, a second EFA was run with only the six retained items and the same loading criteria to see if the factor structure would change. All six items loaded onto one factor as determined by the scree plot and eigenvalues. This factor accounted for 60.95% of the items’ cumulative variance. All six scale items pertaining to a single factor may best be characterized as “sleep regularity.” 3.4. CFA After the removal of 35 multivariate outliers from the subsample, the two-factor model indicated by the exploratory factor analysis was run. All of the scale items loaded significantly onto their respective first-order latent factors, all ps < .001. The correlation between circadian regularity and sleep continuity regularity was .58, p < .001. Model fit was evaluated with previously stated criteria, and was determined to be in the good range, with the exception of the X2 value (X2 = 239.53, df = 8, p < .001; GFI = .948; RMSEA = .134; CFI = .962, NFI = .961; IFI = .962; TLI = .929); however X2 tests are extremely sensitive to large sample sizes, suggesting that this is probably not a good estimate of fit for our sample.35 Based on modification indices, it was determined that correlating the uniqueness terms of items 5 and 6 would greatly improve model fit. Items 5 and 6 ask about the regularity with which someone wakes up (item 5) and gets out of bed (item 6). As the time someone wakes up and the time someone gets out of bed are naturally highly correlated, it was determined to be appropriate to include this modification to the model. Therefore, the two-factor model was re-run after the addition of a correlation path between items 5 and 6 (Figure 2). All of the scale items loaded significantly onto their respective first-order latent factors, all ps < .001. The correlation between circadian regularity and sleep continuity regularity was .66, p < .001. Model fit was evaluated with previously stated criteria, and was determined to be in the good range, with the exception of the X2 value (X2 = 50.9, df = 7, p < .001; GFI = .989; RMSEA = .062; CFI = .993, NFI = .992; IFI = .993; TLI = .985). Finally, a CFA was conducted on the one-factor solution that emerged via the second EFA. All scale items loaded significantly onto their respective first-order latent factor, all ps < .001. Model fit was poor according to previously stated criteria (X2 = 1044.71, df = 9, p < .001; GFI = .827; RMSEA = .268; CFI = .832, NFI = .831; IFI =.832; TLI = .719). Thus, the two factor model with the additional correlation path was retained for all remaining analyses. 3.4.1. Measurement Invariance In order to determine whether the CFA on the final solution differed for men and women, an invariance design was employed as a function of self-reported gender. The analysis evaluated the difference between an unconstrained model, which assumes that the groups are yielding different parameter values when the model is applied to the data, and a constrained model, which assumes that the groups are yielding equivalent parameter values. Three sets of comparisons were of interest: measurement weights, structural covariances, and measurement residuals. The first two sets of comparisons were non-significant (all ps > .520). However, the measurement residual comparison did reach statistical significance, X2(14) = 31.16, p = .005, suggesting that men and women differed in the magnitude of the uniqueness terms of the manifest variables in the model. Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparisons (α = .0083) suggested that none of the error terms individually were noninvariant across the two groups (all zs < 2.64). It may therefore be concluded that the responses of men and women can both be described by the CFA. The CFA generally showed overall strong invariance across men and women. External Validity 3.4.2. Reliability and Validity Assessment Sample 2, the subsample used for CFA analyses, was used for internal consistency and validity assessments. The Cronbach’s α for the total six-item questionnaire was .87. For the four-item circadian regularity subscale, the Cronbach’s α was .88, and .78 for the two-item sleep continuity regularity subscale. Average inter-item correlation ranged from .38 to .85. Test-retest analyses revealed an ICC of .78 [95% CI=. 71 to .83], indicating acceptable reliability over an average of 78 days. Participants’ total score on the SRQ, circadian regularity subscale, and sleep continuity regularity subscale were significantly negatively correlated with participants’ PSQI total score (r = −.37, p < .001; r = −.40, p < .001; r = −.21, p < .001, respectively), indicating that individuals with higher scores on the SRQ (indicating greater sleep regularity) had lower scores on the PSQI (indicating better sleep quality). Participants’ total score on the SRQ, circadian regularity subscale, and sleep continuity regularity subscale were significantly negatively correlated with participants scores on the ISI at total scale score (r = −.39, p < .001; r = −.42, p < .001; r = −.21, p < .001, respectively), indicating that individuals with higher scores on the SRQ (indicating greater sleep regularity) had lower scores on the ISI (indicating fewer insomnia symptoms). Independent samples t-tests revealed that there was significant difference between levels of sleep regularity for good and poor sleepers. Participants with good sleep quality defined by the PSQI had significantly higher sleep regularity (M = 24.91) than those with poor sleep quality defined by the PSQI (M = 21.10), t(1457.52)= −15.244, p < .001. Similarly, participants with ISI-defined good sleep had significantly higher sleep regularity (M = 23.98) than those with ISI-defined poor sleep (M = 20.42), t(1310.32)= 13.61, p < .001. Hierarchical regressions revealed varied levels of incremental validity. For the most part, while the SRQ predicted significant variance above and beyond both the PSQI and ISI, the amount of additional variance predicted was small, with the exception of a medium sized effect of circadian regularity predicting depressive symptoms above and beyond the PSQI (ΔR2 = 0.16, p < .001, f2 = 0.19), see Table 3. Table 3. Note: PHQ-2 = Patient Health Questionnaire – 2 item; GAD-2 = Generalized Anxiety Disorder – 2 item; Physical Health VAS = 0 – 100 visual analog scale. p < .05. 4. Discussion In the present study, a series of analyses was conducted in order to derive and initially test the psychometric properties of a brief questionnaire aimed at assessing the regularity of sleep habits—the Sleep Regularity Questionnaire (SRQ). This questionnaire was designed to serve as a quick, retrospective self-report measure of sleep regularity. EFA revealed a two-factor “circadian regularity” and “sleep continuity regularity” structure of the SRQ. Model fit indices from the CFA showed good fit of the two-factor structure. The summed-total of the final six items of the measure and the four-item circadian regularity subscale demonstrated good internal consistency and the two-item sleep continuity regularity subscale demonstrated acceptable internal consistency. Moreover, test-retest analyses revealed stability over an average of an 11-week period. Invariance analyses suggested that the SRQ is appropriate for use among both men and women, as there were no differences in factor structure between sexes. The SRQ evidenced both concurrent and convergent validity, as it was negatively associated with sleep quality measured via the PQSI and insomnia symptoms measured via the ISI. Finally, the circadian regularity subscale showed some promise for incremental validity in predicting mental health and physical health above commonly used sleep scales. The two-factor solution which emerged from the EFA and CFA represents two distinct aspects of sleep regularity, which largely aligns with the two-process model of sleep.36 In the two process model, Process S represents a homeostatic process, whereas Process C represents a circadian process. The “sleep continuity regularity” factor is most closely aligned with Process S, as items in this factor pertain to nighttime awakenings, which are related to an individual’s homeostatic sleep drive. On the other hand, the “circadian regularity” factor aligns mostly clearly with Process C, as items in this factor pertain to an individual’s natural sleep rhythm. Though the scale item pertaining to sleep duration regularity may at face value be more aligned with Process S, results of the factor analysis revealed that it was more related to Process C. The duration of sleep obtained on any given night is likely the result of a complex interplay between both Process S and C. Our results suggest that the typical regularity of nightly sleep duration is more closely associated with variables commonly associated with circadian processes. Our proposed measure of sleep regularity appears to measure the regularity of the two-processes of sleep regulation, lending credence to our interpretation of the factor analyses, with the EFA and CFA resulting in a two factor model that mirrors the two-process model of sleep.36 The items that did not maintain factor structure are qualitatively unique, as they do not assess sleep or wake time but instead query about feeling refreshed, napping, and weekday-weekend shift. Taken as a whole, the psychometric properties of the SRQ in the present study suggest that it may be a strong measure of sleep regularity for use among English-speaking adults. By developing a brief, self-report measure of sleep regularity, researchers and clinicians alike will be able to quickly and easily assess the consistency or inconsistency in which an individual sleeps and investigate whether this regularity might be an important factor in an individual’s sleep, functional, and/or health outcomes. The SRQ is a unique measure among the numerous self-report sleep questionnaires frequently used in both clinical and research settings. Commonly used self-report measures of sleep query about sleep disturbance,4 insomnia symptoms,5,37 daytime sleepiness,38 and beliefs and attitudes about sleep.39 However, none of the aforementioned questionnaires contain a single item pertaining to the regularity or inconsistency in which these sleep-related thoughts and behaviors occur. This is troubling given the recent evidence6,7,10,13–15 suggestive of the importance of sleep regularity above and beyond habitual sleep habits. The SRQ aims to fill this void with a simple, short, easy to administer and score, retrospective questionnaire. Recent evidence suggests that sleep regularity measured through actigraphy differs between men and women.11 Specifically, inconsistency in terminal wakefulness, time awake after sleep onset, sleep onset latency, number of times awake during the night, and time in bed measured via actigraphy all loaded onto a latent “sleep inconsistency” variable for women but not for men. Furthermore, sleep inconsistency was associated with markers of inflammation for women but not for men. It is possible that, while regularity in actigraphically measured sleep differs for men and women, the self-report measure presented in the present study may be a more universally appropriate measure of sleep regularity, given the findings of sex invariance across the factor structure. While Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has been proven efficacious,40 the search for potential markers of treatment response is an important next step in order to increase the efficiency in which treatment is delivered. Sleep regularity has been shown to have important treatment implications. For example, it has been found that individuals with varying starting levels of sleep regularity respond differently to treatment for insomnia.10,41,42 While the exact nature of this association remains unclear, with some reporting that those with lower baseline regularity in sleep respond better to treatment10,42 and others reporting the opposite,41 what is clear is the potential utility of sleep regularity in aiding in patient and treatment selection. 4.1. Limitations and Future Directions Additional prospective research on the SRQ is warranted. For example, a test-retest study in which the interval of days between assessments is shorter (i.e., an average of 2–4 weeks), or multiple time points are used, may provide more powerful evidence of the measure’s stability. Such examinations would better permit the evaluation of whether sleep regularity is a stable trait or acts in more a state-like fashion. In addition, longitudinal data on various clinical samples would allow for evaluation of the SRQ in response to a focused intervention, such as CBT-I.40,43 A longitudinal study would allow for evaluation of whether improvement in sleep regularity over time, as measured by the SRQ and as a result of CBT-I, is associated with other positive sleep and health outcomes which have largely been elusive.44 This study established the concurrent and convergent validity of the SRQ by comparing scores to measures of commonly used aggregate-based sleep measures, such as the PSQI and the ISI; however, future studies should conduct comparisons of individuals’ SRQ scores to other well-established self-report measures of sleep to establish sleep regularity as a unique construct. Additionally, it will be important to validate the SRQ with conventional measures of sleep regularity. While the literature has shown sleep regularity to be associated with a number of poor health outcomes, sleep regularity in these studies has been measured using daily self-reported sleep diaries,e.g., 45, actigraphy,e.g., 46 polysomnography,e.g., 47 or some combination therein.e.g., 48 Therefore, future studies should examine whether the SRQ is a valid, brief self-report measure of the same sleep regularity computed via those methodologies. The relative lack of racial and ethnic minorities in the present sample did not allow for the examination of whether the SRQ differed by racial and ethnic groups. In light of findings that racial and ethnic minorities are more prone to poor sleep,49,50 future research may benefit from examining the psychometric properties of the scale among different racial minority groups. Future studies should also examine and confirm the reported factor structure of the SRQ when administered in its recommended shortened form (i.e., 6 total items). Such an examination would assure that the obtained factor structure was not dependent on any item-order effects that may have been present in the original 10-item version of the SRQ. Lastly, examination of specific recall periods (e.g., usual sleep vs. previous 2-weeks vs previous 4-weeks) would allow for optimal instruction wording for the SRQ. 4.2. Conclusions The SRQ appears to be a valid and stable instrument for the assessment of sleep regularity in adults that is related to, but distinct from, other established sleep constructs, and it adds to the prediction of sleep-related phenomena beyond existing sleep measures. This short, retrospective questionnaire could provide important information not already captured by existing sleep questionnaires. Its brevity lends itself to both clinical and large survey uses. Future work should include this questionnaire as part of routine batteries to investigate the utility of regular assessment of sleep regularity. Supplementary Material Highlights. Sleep regularity is an important conceptualization of sleep behavior. The Sleep Regularity Questionnaire (SRQ) is a brief, self-report scale. Preliminary psychometrics suggest that the SRQ is a valid and stable instrument. The SRQ is appropriate for use in both male and female samples.

              "content": "The Takeaway - It can be tempting to trade sleep for a few precious hours of wakefulness, but it is important to consider the hidden costs. Sleep is precious, too. - Numerous studies have found that insufficient sleep increases a person's risk of developing serious medical conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. - Lack of adequate sleep over time has been associated with a shortened lifespan. The Hidden Costs of Insufficient Sleep Sleep is often one of the first things to go when people feel pressed for time. Many view sleep as a luxury and think that the benefits of limiting the hours they spend asleep outweigh the costs. People often overlook the potential long-term health consequences of insufficient sleep, and the impact that health problems can ultimately have on one's time and productivity. Many of the costs of poor sleep go unnoticed. Medical conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, develop over long periods of time and result from a number of factors, such as genetics, poor nutrition, and lack of exercise. Insufficient sleep has also been linked to these and other health problems, and is considered an important risk factor. Although scientists have just begun to identify the connections between insufficient sleep and disease, most experts have concluded that getting enough high-quality sleep may be as important to health and well-being as nutrition and exercise. Dr. Lawrence J. Epstein discusses the relationship between sleep deprivation and disease risk. Risk Assessment Determining the risks posed by insufficient sleep is complicated. Medical conditions are slow to develop and have multiple risk factors connected to them. What we do know is that sleeping fewer than about eight hours per night on a regular basis seems to increase the risk of developing a number of medical conditions. The study results below show that reducing sleep by just two or three hours per night can have dramatic health consequences. - Obesity—Several studies have linked insufficient sleep and weight gain. For example, one study found that people who slept fewer than six hours per night on a regular basis were much more likely to have excess body weight, while people who slept an average of eight hours per night had the lowest relative body fat of the study group.1 Another study found that babies who are \"short sleepers\" are much more likely to develop obesity later in childhood than those who sleep the recommended amount.2 - Diabetes—Studies have shown that people who reported sleeping fewer than five hours per night had a greatly increased risk of having or developing type 2 diabetes.3,4 Fortunately, studies have also found that improved sleep can positively influence blood sugar control and reduce the effects of type 2 diabetes.5 - Cardiovascular disease and hypertension—A recent study found that even modestly reduced sleep (six to seven hours per night) was associated with a greatly increased the risk of coronary artery calcification, a predictor of future myocardial infarction (heart attack) and death due to heart disease.6 There is also growing evidence of a connection between sleep loss caused by obstructive sleep apnea and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, and irregular heartbeat.7 - Immune function—Interactions between sleep and the immune system have been well documented. Sleep deprivation increases the levels of many inflammatory mediators, and infections in turn affect the amount and patterns of sleep.8 While scientists are just beginning to understand these interactions, early work suggests that sleep deprivation may decrease the ability to resist infection (see The Common Cold, below). - Common Cold – In a recent study, people who averaged less than seven hours of sleep a night were about three times more likely to develop cold symptoms than study volunteers who got eight or more hours of sleep when exposed to the cold-causing rhinovirus. In addition, those individuals who got better quality sleep were the least likely to come down with a cold. 9 Not surprisingly, these potential adverse health effects can add up to increased health care costs and decreased productivity. More importantly, insufficient sleep can ultimately affect life expectancy and day-to-day well-being. An analysis of data from three separate studies suggests that sleeping five or fewer hours per night may increase mortality risk by as much as 15 percent.10 Dr. Ann E. Rogers discusses the relationship between sleep deprivation, weight gain, and diabetes. Not getting enough sleep alters insulin resistance, which is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and that can be very quickly induced by a single night's total sleep loss. -Dr. Ann E. Rogers Sleeping Well, Staying Healthy While sleeping well is no guarantee of good health, it does help to maintain many vital functions. One of the most important of these functions may be to provide cells and tissues with the opportunity to recover from the wear and tear of daily life. Major restorative functions in the body such as tissue repair, muscle growth, and protein synthesis occur almost exclusively during sleep. Many other conclusions about the role sleep plays in maintaining health have come from studying what happens when humans and other animals are deprived of the sleep they need. For example, scientists have discovered that insufficient sleep may cause health problems by altering levels of the hormones involved in such processes as metabolism, appetite regulation, and stress response.11,12,13 Studies such as these may one day lead to a better understanding of how insufficient sleep increases disease risk. In the meantime, sleep experts say there is ample evidence that shows that when people get the sleep they need, they will not only feel better, but will also increase their odds of living healthier, more productive lives.

              "content": "目录 研究假设（hypothesis）是就实验项目的预期结果所做的简要叙述。研究者通过开展研究，来进一步证实或证伪该假设，从而让读者充分认可研究主题。研究假设作为文章开篇内容中的重要一环，影响着审稿人和读者对文章的第一印象，因而需要作者格外严谨与仔细地对待。 本期，我们将深入探讨研究假设的撰写方法、特点以及相关案例，帮助科研者快速掌握研究假设的写作思路，一起来看看吧！ 如何撰写研究假设？ 在撰写研究假设前，作者可以先全面回顾现有文献，并找出该研究领域的知识空白或问题。而后，通过假设来提出可行的方案，再借助适用的实验方法来证明或反驳研究假设，最终得出研究结果。 现在，让我们来看看常见的研究假设写作示例1： 1 当研究旨在探讨两个变量之间的条件关系时 研究假设可以采用if/then（如果/则）格式，例如： If administered drug X, then patients will experience reduced fatigue from cancer treatment. （如果患者服用了X药物，则会在癌症治疗中减少疲惫感。） 2 当研究假设旨在揭示两个变量之间的联系时 可以采用when X / then Y（当X时/然后Y）的格式，例如： When workers spend a significant portion of their waking hours in sedentary work, then they experience a greater frequency of digestive problems. （当员工在大部分工作时间都久坐不动时，他们的身体会更加频繁地出现消化问题。） 3 直接陈述也是研究假设的一种表达形式 例如： Drug X and drug Y reduce the risk of cognitive decline through the same chemical pathways. （X药物和Y药物通过相同的化学途径，来降低认知能力下降的风险。） 好的研究假设都有哪些特点？ 通常来说，科学严谨的研究假设会满足以下几个特点： 可测试性 保证在论文中研究假设将得到可观测、可检验的结果。 简洁与客观 表达尽量简洁且客观，避免冗长、主观的表达方式。 清晰度与相关度 清楚地反映出某一现象的已知部分和待解决的问题，并说明明该研究致力于填补的知识空白。 了解零假设和备择假设 为有助于统计分析，研究中通常会使用两种类型的假设——零假设（null hypothesis，又称为原假设）和备择假设（alternative hypothesis）。零假设通常在研究的初始阶段被假定为事实，研究者通过收集证据以推翻零假设，支持与之相对的备择假设。 比如，研究人员在测试一种新药的疗效时，零假设为：该药物相较于非活性对照或安慰剂（placebo），没有任何药效。研究人员随后用实验数据推翻了该零假设，证实了这一假设相对的备择假设，即与非活性对照或安慰剂相比，新药是有药效的。 接下来，我们再通过两个示例进一步了解零假设与备择假设： 零假设： The rate of decline in the number of species in habitat X in the last year is the same as in the last 100 years when controlled for all factors except the recent wildfires. （在除近期野火以外的所有因素得到控制后，去年X栖息地物种数量的下降速度与过去100年相比，并无不同。） 在接下来的实验中，研究者将通过实验推翻这一零假设，以证实以下备择假设成立： The rate of decline in the number of species in habitat X in the last year is different from the rate of decline in the last 100 years when controlled for all factors other than the recent wildfires. （在除近期野火以外的所有因素得到控制后，去年X栖息地物种数量的下降速度与过去100年相比，出现了变化。） 这一组零假设和备择假设将去年与过去100年间的物种数量下降速度进行统计比较，有助于通过之后的研究实验来对零假设进行证伪，也有助于就野火和物种减少这两个因素之间的关系得出科学有效的结论。 最后，我们还建议研究者在撰写研究假设时，注意上下文之间的呼应与关联。研究假设往往与引言部分联系紧密2，而引言中的其他内容，如研究背景，也同样会影响读者对研究假设相关性和有效性的判断。 当然，除了提升写作技能，您还可以选择由爱思唯尔语言服务提供的专业指导和协助，省时省力更省心。我们以英语为母语的资深编辑，涵盖 100+学科背景，以顶刊标准帮助科研者更有效地提升包括研究背景在内的文章各部分与整体表达质量，全面提升论文品质，助力您的学术发表之旅！ References - Hypotheses – The University Writing Center.

              "content": "1. 什么是学术论文中的假设（hypothesis）？ 假设是试图解释现实世界中的现象或变量之间关系的一种推测。 假设又被称为有根据的猜测，说的就是假设通常是而且应当是基于过去的观察、现有的理论、科学的证据、正确的逻辑等得出的推测，而不是凭空杜撰出来的猜想。 另外，假设也不是预测（prediction）。预测实际是、而且应当是为了验证假设而产生的活动。 例如，我们有一个预测——“KLF2基因敲除的小鼠会出现心脏发育缺陷”，我们准备通过测试来验证这个预测。导出这一预测的假设实际上是“KLF2基因的产物与小鼠心血管系统的发育有关”。 这里大家能够看出假设和预测之间的微妙差别，而这种差别有时确实让人搞不清楚究竟哪个是哪个。至少从这个例子中可以看出，假设只是陈述两个事物之间存在关联，而预测则是陈述事物发展的某种后果。在提出这句假设时，需要基于某种观察依据，比如具有较低水平的KLF2基因编码的小鼠似乎有心脏问题。这时，就可以提出假设了。然后，基于这个假设，人们可以进一步推断，如果在这种特殊基因不能正常发挥作用的老鼠身上是无法发育出正常的心血管系统的——这种话就变成了预测，而不再只是假设。 那么，学术假设看起来是具有一种比学术预测地位更高的科学理论高度，人们可能会问，预测是不是假设的进一步推理结果或派生子集呢？预测与假设之间，到底是什么样的关系呢？ 在回答这些问题之前，先来看一下假设在科学研究方法上的理论阐释。 提出假设和检验假设是科研方法中的两个重要活动。学术假设的两个特征是可证伪性（即哲学家卡尔·波普尔Karl Popper于1934年提出的评价标准）和可测试性。如果无法用实验测试或分析计算来确定一个想法是否正确，那么这个想法就不能上升为一个假设，只能说是一个想法（idea）——注意这里用词的微妙。 学术假设包括很多不同的类型，而且并不是所有的学术研究工作都需要提出假设或假说。但是，如果提出了假设，那么关于假设的从头到尾的全套任务则需包括以下五点： （1）检查现有的科学证据和理论； （2）提出假设； （3）根据假设做出某种预测； （4）设计实验测试或计算分析检验预测的真伪； （5）得出关于预测和假设的结论。 2. 学术假设的类型 学术假设可以很简单，比如描述一个自变量与一个因变量之间的关系。这里说的自变量是能够观察到变化或能够被操控改变的变量。因变量是受影响而发生变化的变量。如果自变量或因变量都不止一个，那么假设就比较复杂。另外，不同种类的关系还会使假设属于不同的种类，例如因果关系假设。我们通常感兴趣的是所谓的“零假设（null hypothesis）”和与之相对的“备择假设（alternative hypothesis）”。零假设在先，备择假设在后。实际上，人们最关心的是备择假设。因此，下面先讨论备择假设。 - 备择假设（Alternative Hypothesis） 如果需要预测两个变量之间的关系，那么描述这种关系的假设就是备择假设，记作H1。检验假设的目的是提供足够的证据支持备择假设，而不是证明这种关系不存在。备择假设通常就是研究工作的学术假设理论。它通常基于文献研究、过去的观察和已有的理论。 - 零假设（Null Hypothesis） 如果一个假设陈述在变量之间没有关联，就称为零假设，记作H0。根据研究结果，需要在备择假设和零假设之间选择其一，即如果发现预测是正确的，则拒绝零假设而接受备择假设。否则，零假设就是正确的，这时需要拒绝备择假设。 - 定向假设（Directional Hypothesis） 由于零假设说的是变量之间不存在任何关联，那么就谈不上变量朝着哪个方向变化，因此零假设是无方向的。相比之下，备择假设则可以根据观察到的变量之间的关系确定一个变化方向，这就称为定向假设，也称为单侧假设（one-tailed hypothesis）。例如，某种蛋白质水平较高的老鼠比蛋白质水平较低的老鼠更为活跃。另一个定向单侧备择假设的例子如下：H1——在重要考试前参加私教培训对提高成绩有积极影响。对应的零假设可以表达为：H0——在重要考试前参加私教培训对提高成绩没有影响。 - 非方向性假设（Nondirectional Hypothesis） 当假设不指定变量的任何变化方向而仅说明在变量之间存在某种关系时，这种假设就称为非方向性假设，又称双尾假设（two-tailed hypothesis）。例如，在新药研究中，实验室的体外实验显示该药物对治疗某种病症（如焦虑症）产生积极影响，但是并不能肯定它在动物模型中也会产生相同的积极影响，也无法确定它是否会产生负面影响而增加焦虑水平。那么，可以这样陈述非方向性假设：H1——仅经过实验室测试的药物在患有焦虑症的小鼠模型中会影响焦虑水平。对应的零假设为：H0——在患有焦虑症的小鼠模型中，仅经过实验室测试的药物对焦虑水平没有影响。 3. 撰写学术假设的步骤 在论文中撰写学术假设需要包括以下几步。 第1步 根据既往研究提出一个问题。科研工作总是以提问发端。提问不能天马行空、不着边际，而必须考虑过去的文献在这个问题上已经积累了哪些知识。例如，如果你想调查养宠物的人是否比不养宠物的人更加快乐，那你应该先搜索一下文献，找出人们做过哪些研究。这时，你会意识到有相当多的研究表明，快乐感与养宠物之间是存在关系的。甚至会有研究表明，养狗比养猫对人更有好处！当你看到这篇研究文献时，你便会开始发问：“是什么让养狗的人比养猫的人更快乐呢？”这时，你就提出了一个有效的科学问题。然后，进入第二步，去寻找这个问题的答案。 第2步 回答你自己提出的问题，构造强有力的学术假设。这时，仍然既不能凭空捏造，也不能重复或忽视别人已经做过的研究。以关于猫狗比较的研究为例，你可能发现过去的大多数研究工作都是基于性格、心理健康程度和生活满意度的问卷调查。你还没有找到任何关于心理或身体健康方面的测试数据。因此，你决定大胆断言，提出一个经过深思熟虑的学术假设——狗主人的生活方式（包括每天遛狗几次，参加诸如敏捷性比赛等有趣而健康的活动，带狗旅行等）与他们的快乐感有关。因此，你可以构造这样一个学术假设，来回答自己在第1步提出的问题：“养狗的人比养猫的人更快乐，这与养狗的人参与的宠物活动有关”。 现在，需要验证这个学术假设是否满足在本文开头介绍的那两个要求：可证伪性和可测试性。如果一个学术假设既不能被证明是错误的，也无法测试验证，那么它就谈不上是一个学术假设。在上例中，我们可以测试发现，拥有一只狗但不参与任何宠物活动，相比于拥有一只狗并与它一起玩耍、奔跑或旅行，究竟哪种生活方式会导致更少的快乐感。 第3步 定义变量并预测影响。由于学术假设是可以被检验的，因此需要定义相关变量，设计实验测试或分析计算，进行准确的预测。例如，你决定研究狗主人的行为，请他们填写调查问卷，了解他们的生活方式和生活满意度，就像其他调查性研究所做的那样。然后，你可以将一组活跃的狗主人与一组不活跃的狗主人进行对比。或者，你还可以设计实施干预狗主人活动水平的实验，以便研究这种干预行为所产生的影响。例如，你可以邀请狗主人到实验室来，对成组的具有相似生活方式的受试者进行行为干预，改变他们的生活方式，包括针对比较慵懒的狗主人开设敏捷度练习课程，而针对非常活跃的狗主人则在一段时间内压制他们的娱乐活动。然后，在干预前后分别评估他们的快乐感水平。在这些实验中，自变量是与狗进行娱乐活动的参与度，而因变量是快乐感。 4. 科学假设的例子 下表展示一些写得比较好的和写得比较差的学术假设的例子。 写得比较好的学术假设例子 写得比较坏的学术假设例子 5. 撰写学术假设的技巧 正确构造学术假设和开展预测包括以下四项举措：（1）调查现有证据；（2）提出一个假设；（3）做出一个预测；（4）设计一个实验进行验证。 例如，关于上述养狗与快乐感之间的关系，可以这样开展研究：（1）虽然研究表明养狗的人比养猫的人更加快乐，但是过去的研究并没有揭示原因。（2）假设狗主人与宠物一起参与活动是造成快乐感较强的原因，因为很多狗主人都乐于参与宠物活动，而猫主人则很少参与。（3）我们预测，阻止非常活跃的狗主人在一段时间内参与宠物活动会导致快乐感减少，而鼓励不活跃的狗主人参与宠物活动会导致快乐感增强。（4）为了测试这个预测，我们邀请狗主人到实验室来，通过问卷评估其精神和情绪健康状况，然后将他们分为活跃和不活跃的两组受试者，具体取决于某些评判标准（此处略去）。 需要注意的是，“我们假设（we hypothesize）”这个词只能用于假设（hypothesis），而不能用于实验预测（prediction）；而“would”或“if – then”这种词汇只能用于预测，而不能用于假设。如果在假设中用“would”这种词去陈述某件事可能会影响另一件事，那么听起来就像是你自己都没有足够的信心做出这样的假设陈述，那就更不能指望读者会坚信你的假设。 因此，在撰写学术假设时，需要使用一般现在时，而不应使用带有不确定性的情态动词（例如may、might、could）。同样地，当解释研究工作的含义或在论文的结论部分描述预测结果时，不要使用“我们假设”（we hypothesize）这种话。 许多论文的作者可能不太在意这些微妙的用词差别。但是，需要注意的是，于细微处见功夫，在陈述学术假设的整套工作中用词缜密，不仅能够帮助读者准确理解论文，而且能够使那些苛刻的审稿人找不到什么理由来挑剔你的论文。 6. 依靠专业的英语编辑完善论文语言品质 撰写强有力的学术假设是建立学术理论的基础。英文语言的表达也同样重要。 大家可以了解一下Wordvice AI 智能写作助手，具备免费论文语法检查工具和论文改写润色工具， 这两项功能可以极好地帮助润色论文的语言表达，还有在线翻译，在线查重，AI率检测等多种功能，在起拟英语论文初稿的阶段，可以起到很大帮助。 您也可以联系我们Wordvice，使用专业英文论文润色服务。 另外，Wordvice的学术资源博客里还提供了大量优质博客文章，能够帮助论文的作者撰写论文的其他部分，包括论文提纲和投稿信。 需要英文润色，英语润色，就找Wordvice。 | 资源博客 | 学术论文润色 | 学术论文翻译 | 期刊论文润色 | 毕业论文润色 | 论文摘要润色 | 服务费用 | FAQ |",

In this paper, 55 subjects with different chronotypes were subjected to continuous sleep deprivation for 30 h by using the constant routine protocol, during which core body temperature was measured continuously, and subjective sleepiness self-rating and the performance of selective attention were measured hourly. The results showed that the phase difference of core body temperature has no significant difference, yet the amplitude and term difference among the three chronotypes are significant. There was an advance in phase between subjective sleepiness self-rating and core body temperature, and the self-rating sleepiness of evening type came the latest, and the self-rating sleepiness of morning type dissipated the fastest. The response time of selective attention showed a 2 h phase delay with subjective sleepiness self-rating. And the analysis of core body temperature showed that the later the chronotype was, the greater the phase delay was. The correct rate of selective attention of different chronotypes were inconsistent with delay of subjective sleepiness self-rating and core body temperature. We provide reference for industry, aviation, military, medical and other fields to make a more scientific scheduling/ shifting based on cognitive performance characteristics of different chronotypes. Keywords: Chronotype, Sleep deprivation, Selective attention, Circadian rhythm, Homeostasis 引言 人类睡眠—觉醒周期存在个体偏好，表现为不同的睡眠类型（chronotype）：早晨型（morning type）倾向早睡早起，夜晚型（evening type）习惯晚睡晚起，中间型（inter-mediate type）介于这两者之间，并无极端偏好[1-2]。人类能自主运行约24 h的内源性周期被称为昼夜节律（circadian rhythm）[3]。不同睡眠类型个体因其生物钟调节人体代谢周期和维持内环境稳态在时间上存在相位差[4]，其认知能力也表现出各自节律性特征[5-8]。内稳态（homeostasis）是生物体通过自我调节维持内环境相对稳定持久的主要机制[9]。睡眠内稳态更多体现在腺苷（adenosine，AD）的变化[10]，由三磷酸腺苷（adenosine triphosphate，APT）分解产生，随清醒时间延长并逐渐积累与大脑皮层中的特殊受体结合，从而抑制大脑皮层兴奋性，导致个体嗜睡感增加[11]，在睡眠时，其代谢率大于产生率，AD逐渐消散[12]。 基本认知过程会受到以核心体温（core body temperature，CBT）为代表的昼夜节律和以随清醒时间延长而增加的睡眠内驱动力为代表的内稳态二者共同影响[13-14]。在连续绩效任务（continuous performance task，CPT）中[5-8]，选择性注意（selective attention，SEA）表现出内稳态和昼夜节律变化特征[15]。SEA在一天中不同时刻与CBT的节律变化相关[16]，在夜间和早晨达到最低水平，中午阶段逐步上升，下午和晚上出现最高水平[17-18]，整体上SEA随着睡眠剥夺时间延长而下降。不同睡眠类型个体SEA的昼夜节律特征存在差异[19]。早晨型在早上进行智力活动效率最高，夜晚型在下午或晚上表现更佳，中间型则处于这两者之间[20]。在夜晚，早晨型精神运动警觉任务（psychomotor vigilance task，PVT）失误（lapse）次数相对明显增加，而在早上，夜晚型的工作绩效则比早晨型更低[21]。夜晚型在斯特鲁普效应（Stroop effect）任务和PVT任务中都表现出同步效应（synchrony effects），而早晨型的这两个任务只在早上时段表现出同步效应[22]。此外，在睡眠剥夺后，不同睡眠类型个体在其最佳绩效时间段内认知绩效受到影响的程度不同[23]，早晨型比夜晚型表现出更长的反应时间和更高的错误率。然而，也有学者认为认知过程与体温的昼夜节律并不同步，而存在1～4 h的相位差[24]。在睡眠剥夺情况下，不同睡眠类型SEA是否与其CBT存在相位差尚不明确。 判断睡眠类型的黄金标准是测量暗光环境下人体血液等组织样本中褪黑素（melatonin）含量[25-26]。睡眠类型也可以通过自评方式来测量，如慕尼黑睡眠类型问卷（Munich chrono type questionnaire，MCTQ）[27]，清晨型—夜晚型问卷（morningness-eveningness questionnaire，MEQ）[2]。2006年，张斌等[28]已成功完成MEQ量表的中文本地化修订工作。2020年，也有学者对中国人群进行了广泛调查，并首次对中国人群的睡眠类型分布进行了概述[29]。当前针对注意绩效与睡眠类型的研究方法仍然存在以下局限性：首先，以往的研究中大多使用直肠温度作为人体CBT，前者虽然优于皮温，但与人体核心脏器温度相比仍然存在差异，并不十分准确；Valdez等[5-6]利用CPT测试中使用1～9数字作为刺激材料，其中“1”、“2”、“3”同时也是反应按键，具有双重角色，这种设计导致受试者注意的指向性不能科学地评估出“注意”中SEA的本质；其次，在以往研究“注意”时，并没有考虑由于个体睡眠类型不同而带来结果差异；此外，SEA与人体昼夜节律是否同步或存在相位差尚不明确。鉴于此，本文将优化Valdez等[5-6]对SEA的评估方法，探讨不同睡眠类型群体在睡眠剥夺条件下，注意组成部分中SEA的节律差异及其与内稳态和昼夜节律的关系，为不同睡眠类型群体的倒班、轮班设计提供参考，这也是国内首次探究长时间觉醒对不同睡眠类型群体认知绩效影响机制及其应用的研究。 1. 试验过程 1.1. 试验对象 本试验一共有55名大学生受试者，其中男性38名，女性17名，年龄范围19～24岁，平均年龄20.82岁，标准差（standard deviation，SD） = 1.71；身体质量指数（body mass index，BMI）范围16.22～33.20，平均BMI = 22.40，SD = 3.38。受试者身体健康，无睡眠障碍。在试验前24 h，禁止服用咖啡、酒精、烟草、任何药物或超热量食物等。为避免女性生理期对CBT的影响，在筛选受试者时，避免招募生理期到来的前3 d和生理期结束的后3 d之间的女性作为受试者。 1.2. 试验材料 受试者需填写：① 基本信息表，包括姓名、性别、年龄、身高、体重以及试验当日早醒时间；② 睡眠日志，记录两个星期内早醒时间、晚上进入睡眠的时间、午休时间和必要备注；③

如图1所示，要求受试者按照任务规则进行判断，首先判断符号A1与B1是否一致，若不一致，按键盘“J”键，若一致，按键盘“F”键；按“F”键之后下一次呈现的刺激中判断A1与B2是否一致，若一致，按键盘“空格（space）”键，不一致，按“J”键。受试者按键反应后，刺激消失，随机时间间隔2～6 s后，呈现下一个刺激，刺激间隔期间在屏幕正中呈现一个字号为30的红色“+”注视点。每组测试共呈现128次不重复刺激。 1.4. 试验过程 在试验日前两个星期，受试者按照自我睡眠作息习惯来进行作息并填写睡眠日志。在正式试验两天前，利用MEQ将受试者睡眠类型分类，并对受试者进行必要培训。在试验当日，受试者来到中国民航大学民航安全科学研究所的实验室准备开始正式试验，填写基本信息、知情同意书、PSQI问卷和当日早醒时间。 试验采用固定作息法范式（constant routine protocol，CRP），三种睡眠类型受试者分别于早上8:00、7:00、6:00醒来，试验记录开始时间分别为10:00、9:00、8:00，在第二天的下午14:00、13:00、12:00结束，持续清醒时间为30 h。试验期间受试者保持持续清醒，每30 s采集一次体温胶囊数据，每1 min采集一次人体活动监测设备数据。每1 h采集一次主观嗜睡程度（受试者填写KSS）和注意绩效测试任务结果，测试次数共29次。试验期间提供水和食物：果汁、脱脂牛奶、全麦面包、全麦饼干、鸡胸肉、榨菜等。根据联合国粮食及农业组织（Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations，FAO）/世界卫生组织（World Health Organization，WHO）/联合国大学（United Nations University，UNU）公式[31]、米弗林－圣杰奥公式（Mifflin-St Jeor Equations，MSJE）[32]、个体性别、年龄、身高、体重，计算出个体基础代谢率（basal metabolic rate，BMR）、静息能量消耗（resting energy expenditure，REE）[33]、每日总能量消耗（total daily energy expenditure，TDEE）[34]，受试者每小时进食一份含有自身一天能量消耗的1/24食物量。 试验期间保持恒定的环境条件，室内温度（24 ± 1）℃，室内水平照度70～100 lux，受试者除了去卫生间外，其余时间均以固定姿势和角度坐在椅子上，最大程度避免其他体力活动。本研究已得到中国民航大学安全科学与工程学院伦理审查委员会的审批（批文编号：CAUC-PSY-2021-012）。 2. 数据处理与分析 在29次注意绩效测试中有2名中间型受试者分别在首次测试、首次和第二次测试中，出现混淆按键、忘记测试规则，导致测试误差，其数据未被采纳。因受试者进行其他生理指标的数据采集并补充能量（饮食饮水），致使在本测试节点时间范围内没有时间对其进行注意绩效的补测。本试验利用肖维勒准则（Chauvenet criterion）剔除受试者在注意绩效测试任务中的极大离异点[35]，肖维勒准则可表示为如式（1）～式（2）所示： 其中，x为离异数据，μ为样本平均值，ωn为肖维勒准则系数，σ为样本标准差，n为样本量。 同时为排除受试者在试验过程中“抢跑”（false start）或误答，本研究也将200 ms以下的数据排除[36]。 KSS分值通过洛伦兹方程（Lorentze quation）曲线拟合，得到主观嗜睡的洛伦兹方程表达式，洛伦兹方程可表示为如式（3）所示： 其中，Y为函数值，Y0为起始值，A为面积，xc为中心值，ω为半峰全宽（full width at half maxima，FWHM）。 CBT使用萨维茨基—戈雷（Savitzky-Golay，S-G）平滑滤波处理[37]，一种在时域内基于局部多项式最小二乘拟合的滤波方法。使用该平滑滤波对CBT进行处理，最大程度保留原始数据的同时能够将异常值进行有效过滤，保证了数据的有效性和纯净度。将S-G平滑滤波处理后的数据，使用正弦曲线拟合，正弦方程可表示为如式（4）所示： 其中，Y为函数值，Y0为起始值，A为振幅，xc为相位，ω为角速度。 针对三种睡眠类型个体，本文采用弗里德曼（Friedman）非参数检验评估其CBT、KSS分值及SEA的组内差异，采用克鲁斯卡尔—沃利斯（Kruskal-Wallis）非参数检验评估其KSS分值的组间差异。通过线性回归分析，计算三种睡眠类型的KSS分值、SEA反应时、SEA正确率的趋势，得到线性回归系数Beta。采用交叉相关分析（cross-correlation function，CCF），计算KSS分值和CBT与SEA之间的交叉相关系性（cross-correlation）和相位差（Δφ/h）来确定其相位的相关程度。 3. 结果 3.1. 睡眠类型 受试者共55人，其中夜晚型12人，中间型24人，早晨型19人，MEQ平均得分51.71，SD = 10.08，克朗巴哈系数（Cronbach）α = 0.835，凯撒—迈耶—奥利金（Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin，KMO）为0.814，P < 0.05。 3.2. PSQI问卷 本试验发放PSQI问卷55份，有效回收问卷54份，平均得分4.56，SD = 2.66，Cronbach α = 0.770，KMO = 0.698，P < 0.05。 3.3. 体温节律 对三种睡眠类型CBT进行弗里德曼非参数检验的结果显示：夜晚型（χ2 = 98.817，P < 0.05）、中间型（χ2 = 155.218，P < 0.05）、早晨型（χ2 = 179.216，P < 0.05）均呈现出明显的昼夜节律。 如图2所示，首先针对三种睡眠类型的CBT变化趋势，均在早上较低，从上午10:00左右上升，直至傍晚20:00左右达到最高点后逐步下降，在夜间下降速度增加，在凌晨04:00～07:00达到低谷后再开始逐渐上升。其次，关于三种睡眠类型的CBT范围，夜晚型CBT在36.54～37.34 ℃之间，温度变化（ΔCBT）0.80 ℃，平均温度（CBT）为36.94 ℃；中间型CBT在36.58～37.28 ℃之间，ΔCBT = 0.70 ℃，CBT = 36.96 ℃；早晨型CBT在36.65～37.34 ℃之间，ΔCBT = 0.69 ℃，CBT = 37.0 ℃。经过对三种睡眠类型CBT进行正弦曲线拟合，如图2所示，其中夜晚型（R2 = 0.928，P < 0.05）周期T = 28.07 h，对称轴x1 = 17:58、x2 = 08:00；中间型（R2 = 0.903，P < 0.05）T = 26.70 h，x1 = 17:35、x2 = 06:56；早晨型（R2 = 0.836，P < 0.05）T = 27.88 h，x1 = 17:38、x2 = 07:34。 3.4. 主观嗜睡自评 KSS作为主观嗜睡自评应用较为广泛的量表（Cronbach α = 0.943，KMO = 0.851，P < 0.05），如图2所示，三种睡眠类型的KSS分值，夜晚型、中间型、早晨型KSS分值均出现较为明显的波峰和周期性特征。其中，夜晚型KSS分值在3.17～7.42之间，分值变化（ΔKSS）为4.25，KSS平均分值（KSS）为4.77；中间型KSS分值在2.71～7.54之间，ΔKSS = 4.83，KSS = 5.13；早晨型KSS分值在2.93～7.16之间，ΔKSS = 4.23，KSS = 4.77。如图2所示，三种睡眠类型KSS分值经过洛伦兹方程曲线拟合，均出现随清醒时间延长而逐渐上升趋势，如表1所示，线性回归系数均大于0.7。 表 1. Statistical analysis results of subjective sleepiness self-rating of three chronotypes. 对KSS与CBT进行交叉相关分析发现，如表1所示，KSS分值与CBT出现1～2 h的相位差Δφ，并且呈现负相关。KSS分值在白天较低，此时CBT较高；在夜间KSS分值逐渐上升且上升幅度增大，但CBT则呈下降趋势；在凌晨04:00～07:00时，KSS分值达到最高，CBT则达到最低点。 3.5. 注意绩效测试结果 根据“注意”的内涵[24]，SEA是对一种刺激产生特定反应，而对其他刺激不产生特定反应的能力，本测试任务中受试者按键盘“F”键所对应的反应时与正确率作为其评估指标。 如图3、表2所示，分别展示了三种睡眠类型SEA随清醒时间延长的反应时和正确率的变化特征与统计结果。 表 2. Statistical analysis results of SEA of three chronotypes. SEA反应时与KSS分值随时间的变化趋势均具有同步性。弗里德曼非参数检验结果表示差异具有统计学意义，注意绩效呈现出明显的内稳态特征，日间反应时较短，从夜间开始逐渐变长；直到第二天早晨06:00～09:00到达峰值，随后开始逐渐下降；线性回归系数皆大于0.7，整体趋势呈上升。 而SEA正确率整体呈下降趋势，并且弗里德曼非参数检验结果显示注意各绩效指标的正确率差异部分有统计学意义，并且在长时间的清醒过程中出现多峰多谷的情况。SEA正确率的低谷在下午、晚上及清晨均有出现，且在清晨时低谷的幅度更加明显。这与“状态不稳定”假说相一致，该假说认为，随着清醒时间的延长或睡眠剥夺的延长，睡眠压力会积累并增加变异性[38]。 针对与KSS和CBT的交叉相关分析，SEA反应时和正确率分别产生了不同程度的相位延迟和相关性。SEA反应时与KSS分值呈正相关，且存在2 h的相位延迟；与CBT呈负相关，但存在1～3 h的相位延迟。而SEA正确率则相反，与KSS分值呈负相关，且只有夜晚型存在3 h相位延迟；与CBT呈现正相关，存在0～1 h相位延迟。这里并不支持Kleitman[39]提出的假说，即绩效的变化是由于体温波动引起的身体和大脑代谢的变化。 4. 讨论 首先关于主观嗜睡感，三种睡眠类型KSS分值差异较为明显，整体呈上升趋势，均表现出明显的内稳态特征。夜晚型相较其他两种类型线性回归系数较小，并且其嗜睡感到来较晚，根据克鲁斯卡尔—沃利斯非参数检验结果显示：从20:00才开始上升（χ2 = 7.78，P < 0.05），在21:00（χ2 = 6.91，P < 0.05）、22:00（χ2 = 7.16，P < 0.05）、23:00（χ2 = 13.32，P < 0.05）、24:00（χ2 = 6.44，P < 0.05）与中间型和早晨型有差别。相对于中间型与早晨型，夜晚型嗜睡感不仅出现时刻相对较晚、持续时间较短而且峰值出现也较晚，与早晨型和中间型有1 h的Δφ。而早晨型在上午嗜睡感消退得会迅速一些。 SEA绩效在长时间清醒中均表现出下降趋势，结果表明疲劳效应的存在。在SEA指标中，早晨型正确率的线性回归系数更趋近于零，平均正确率更高，平均反应时更小，表明在长时间清醒过程中，早晨型的正确决策能力更加突出。上述发现不能排除与试验时间有关（从第一天的早上到第二天的中午前后），白天的试验时间大于夜间，这也就造成了早晨型更多的“同步效应”。 为降低研究中试验开始时间的设计可能“更有利于”呈现早晨型的“同步效应”，如图4所示，本研究将觉醒时间分为四个阶段，第一天上午到下午（17:00）为“阶段1”，夜晚型和早晨型表现出较快的SEA反应速度；中间型表现出较高的正确率。傍晚（18:00～22:00）为“阶段2”，夜晚型反应更加迅速；而中间型正确率与白天相反，降至最低。夜间（23:00～06:00）为“阶段3”，夜晚型反应速度相较更快，并且正确率也是三种睡眠类型中最高的。第二天白天开始（07:00）为“阶段4”，早晨型注意绩效开始回升，SEA反应时相较最短；对比“阶段3”正确率，中间型和夜晚型下降幅度较大，早晨型更加稳定。值得注意的是，在试验全程中，中间型反应时相较都是最慢的。 SEA的神经生理基础主要是大脑的背外侧前额叶和顶叶区[40]，而前额叶皮层是大脑中容易受睡眠缺乏而影响的区域[41]。夜晚型的前额叶在傍晚激活提升，在夜间激活程度达到高峰；在第二天的上午，中间型激活水平大幅度下降，而早晨型则会保持较为稳定的水平。绩效的下降可能与睡眠剥夺会对前额叶脑功能受损有关[42]，而中间型受损程度会更大一些。 如图3所示，进一步明确了不同睡眠类型的注意绩效峰值时间，早晨型最佳注意绩效较早出现（07:00 ± 01:00），中间型次之（08:00 ± 01:00），夜晚型最迟（09:00 ± 01:00），该特征可能是由于节律基因和生活环境带来的作息习惯所导致的。 本研究也进一步证实了注意绩效与主观嗜睡程度KSS分值所代表的内环境稳态和CBT所代表的昼夜节律存在一定相位差值。如表2所示，三种睡眠类型SEA的反应时与KSS分值均有2 h的延迟；而SEA正确率，夜晚型则有3 h的较大延迟。 在与CBT的交叉相关分析中，本研究发现三种睡眠类型SEA反应时与CBT的Δφ并不呈现一致性：夜晚型反应时与CBT有3 h的延迟，其次是中间型有2 h的延迟，最后是早晨型有1 h的延迟，即睡眠习惯越早，SEA反应时与CBT的Δφ就会延迟的更少。 5. 结论 本文采用固定作息法范式，主要分析了在30 h睡眠剥夺情况下，三种睡眠类型个体CBT、KSS分值、SEA随时间变化的特征及其相互间的相关性。三种睡眠类型的CBT具有明显的昼夜节律特征，相位差异较小，但振幅与周期差异明显。 在30 h的睡眠剥夺中，三种睡眠类型KSS分值整体呈现上升趋势，夜晚型嗜睡感出现较迟，早晨型恢复得更快，且夜晚型和早晨型KSS分值与CBT存在较明显的相位提前现象。 在30 h的睡眠剥夺中，三种睡眠类型注意绩效整体是下降的。夜晚型在傍晚和夜间（23:00～05:00）SEA反应速度更快，早晨型从第二天上午（07:00）开始，SEA恢复更明显，此外前额叶在中间型中更加敏感，更易受损。 本研究发现不同睡眠类型SEA反应时与CBT的延迟并不相同，即睡眠类型越早，其延迟程度越小，MEQ分值与延迟程度呈负相关。因此，不能仅仅根据CBT的高峰或低谷来推测此时作业人员的工作绩效，尤其是夜晚型人群。且不同睡眠类型SEA反应时与KSS分值均呈现2 h的相位延迟，而在正确率中，只有夜晚型有3 h的较大延迟。 未来，本研究还可进一步分析不同睡眠类型的注意绩效昼夜节律差异，将测量睡眠－觉醒的金标准——褪黑素、皮质醇等作为参考指标；降低“同步效应”影响的同时，设计从傍晚开始试验，并且进一步明确三种睡眠类型的其他注意组成部分中哪些受内环境稳态影响多，哪些受昼夜节律影响多，哪些独立于这两种因素。综上，本研究可解释在工业、安全、航空、军事、医疗等各领域信息处理或决策过程中，记忆任务、阅读、算术运算或机械作业等昼夜节律变化，同时根据其睡眠类型更好地发挥认知绩效，为制定科学排班/轮班提供参考。 重要声明 利益冲突声明：本文全体作者均声明不存在利益冲突。 作者贡献声明：李敬强：总体规划、试验设计、论文修改；王庆福：试验设计、试验组织、数据分析、论文撰写；张璐、张希凝、周妍汝、张焕晰：试验组织、数据分析。 伦理声明：本研究通过了中国民航大学安全科学与工程学院科学研究伦理委员会的审批（批文编号：CAUC-PSY-2021-012）。 Funding Statement 国家自然科学基金（U1933122）；中央高校基本科研业务费专项资金（3122019186） The National Natural Science Foundation of China; The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities References - 1.Randler C, Engelke J Gender differences in chronotype diminish with age: a meta-analysis based on morningness/chronotype questionnaires.

              "content": "本文来源于公众号：神经病学思辨 人的生命状态无非是觉醒和睡眠两种,觉醒状态下可以保证高效的学习和工作，而良好的睡眠又是维持长期清醒的必备条件，睡眠是大脑功能活动的另一种状态，大脑在睡眠中并不是“关机”了，而是“切换了工作模式”。睡眠的发生是生物昼夜节律驱动的结果，它是一个复杂的、精确的调节过程。 睡眠的双进程理论模型是睡眠医学界最为广泛接受的理论并一直沿用至今。双进程模型认为睡眠是内稳态系统（Process S – Sleep-wake homeostasis）与昼夜节律系统（Process C - Circadian rhythm）相互作用,调控的结果。 一，昼夜节律系统（生物钟） 昼夜节律是人体生物钟的一部分，在体内许多生物过程中发挥核心作用(包括睡眠)，当外部环境和内部生物钟出现不匹配，就可能出现紊乱，比较典型的就是当我们旅行穿越多个时区而产生“时差”的感觉。 生物钟不仅影响着我们什么时候睡觉和醒来，还影响着我们日常的生活节奏，从新陈代谢到肌肉生长。大脑的\"主时钟\"（位于下丘脑的神经元-视交叉上核）会发出工作的信号（分泌激素、调节体温等），设定有规律的生活节奏，让身体机能保持在最佳状态上。 人体复杂的昼夜节律系统还依赖\"授时因子\"运行。授时因子是外源性环境因子（比如光、温度、社会交互作用、运动、饮食模式等。生活方式），可以使生物体的内部时钟与地球的24小时光明、黑暗周期和12个月周期同步，应用不当也会扰乱生物钟，我们还可以利用\"授时因子\"来重置生物钟或引导生物钟调整回来。 关键的授时因子 对睡眠来说，自然光是一种重要的授时因子。眼睛接收到自然光后，会不断地测量光线强度，并将这些信息传递给身体的\"主时钟\"。然后，大脑会相应地控制身体增加或减少褪黑素的分泌，进而影响我们的睡眠。 饮食也是对睡眠影响很大的一种授时因子，因为人体在24小时的周期内对食物的代谢能力是不同的。研究表明，吃饭的时间会改变我们睡觉或醒来的时间，经常吃零食会打乱睡眠规律，导致体重增加、精神萎靡、新陈代谢减慢等问题。甚至有一些研究表明，对于某些身体系统和功能来说，进餐时间可能比光线更重要。 外部温度也是一种授时因子，它可以影响睡眠觉醒周期。 运动也是一种授时因子。研究发现，早上或下午早些时候运动能够使生物钟\"提前\"，让我们提前入睡。而在睡前一两个小时内运动可能会推迟入睡时间。 遗传机制也参与生物钟的运作，基因也会影响昼夜节律系统。有研究显示，所有人都有着自己独特的昼夜节律表型。粗略而看，人群中大约 40% 是“晨鸟”，30% 是“夜猫子”，30% 介于两者之间。年龄、性别和外界环境（光线强度等）会影响我们每个人独特的昼夜节律表明，而基因也是一个重要的决定因素。 图1，生物钟调节分布模式 生物钟的调节能力 昼夜节律具有极强的韧性以及可塑性。改善睡眠卫生的一项核心理念便是根据你的昼夜节律，保持一致的就寝和起床时间。昼夜节律对机体的影响是获取优质睡眠的第一步，规律的作息是保持生物钟平稳、规律的关键。有规律地入睡、起床，在早上尽可能多地接触自然光，保持稳定的运动时间和吃饭时间，都可以保持生物钟的稳定。同时，我们还可以围绕着当天的能量高峰与低谷时间来制定工作学习计划，从而提升我们的工作效率。 二，睡眠-觉醒稳态（内稳态系统） 睡眠除了受昼夜节律（生物钟）的驱动外，还存在一种稳态机制，它接受体内的生物钟控制。睡眠稳态是睡眠-觉醒周期最重要的特征，描述了睡眠-觉醒之间的动态平衡。通俗地讲，睡眠稳态主要与睡眠压力密切相关，睡眠内稳态系统的睡眠压力，会在每天早晨醒来后开始累积，即“睡眠压力”增加，直到你的入睡时间。随着睡眠的进行，其睡眠压力被逐渐清除。我们将这种白天睡眠压力积累与夜间重制的过程称为睡眠内稳态系统。内稳态系统是否正常，关键在于白天与黑夜间睡眠压力的平衡，在这期间睡眠-唤醒这两者相互遏制，相互促进。如果在入睡前，睡眠压力达不到既定水平，就会产生入睡困难等问题，因此强调“无睡意，不上床”的睡眠习惯其原理就是源于此。 目前认为，包括腺苷在内的一些代谢分子和蛋白磷酸化等胞内生化过程介导了觉醒期间睡眠压力的升高，认为腺苷是我们困意的重要来源（咖啡因是是一种非选择性腺苷受体拮抗剂,是广泛使用的促觉醒精神刺激剂）。这种有机化合物与睡眠压力息息相关，从早晨觉醒后便开始在大脑中积累。随着腺苷水平的升高，觉醒力下降，困倦感加强。而在睡眠状态下，大脑会开始清除自身的腺苷，从而有效地重制第二天的睡眠压力水平。在睡眠内稳态系统内，觉醒和睡眠这两种状态的“跷跷板”，会无间断的平衡自己。如果睡眠不足，就无法完全清除腺苷，会加重失眠的负面影响。研究发现，在连续17个小时不睡觉后，人的专注力受到损害，其警觉性水平将等同于0.05%的血液酒精浓度；在缺乏睡眠24个小时后，人体的状态就等同于醉驾水平（血液酒精浓度的0.1%），出现反应时间延长、运动控制力减弱，也会降低人的判断力、注意力、思考和记忆能力，还容易激发人的负面情绪如暴怒和敌意等状况。超过三成的致命车祸都涉及睡眠负债（内稳态系统的睡眠压力）问题。 熬夜与补觉或许可以调节睡眠压力问题，而通过专业的睡眠监测，睡眠日志等临床科学手段可以精准描绘出我们独特睡眠压力特点，并通过良好睡眠习惯的养成，持续保持觉醒或睡眠这两种状态的“跷跷板”的平衡将会帮助我们收获优质的睡眠，以及健康的生活与工作状态。 图2，理想情况下，昼夜节律和睡眠稳态，这两大系统协同引发睡意，是获取优质睡眠的关键所在 目前，睡眠稳态和睡眠节律的调控的研究主要可以分成两个“学派”：一个是从基因分子等入手，研究睡眠稳态的调控。另一个是从神经环路角度入手，研究不同脑区对睡眠觉醒的调控。 睡眠调控的神经机制非常复杂，近年来，得益于研究手段的进步，揭示了睡眠-觉醒行为的调控涉及大脑内多个不同脑区中特定种类神经元, 睡眠-觉醒其实是一个多脑区协同作用的结果，而非某一个特定脑区调控的结果。 其中基底前脑是关键的脑区之一，丘脑是掌管睡眠的重要部位，是人类最早发现影响睡眠的重要脑区。下丘脑外侧中有一组γ-氨基丁酸（GABA）能神经元细胞。该神经元细胞的激活和睡眠行为存在关联，其有调节睡眠-觉醒循环的功能，与睡眠时长、睡眠深度息息相关。研究人员还指出，在长时间清醒而积累困意的过程中，大脑基底前脑区的谷氨酸能神经元，也扮演了重要的角色。这些神经元既维持和促进了觉醒，又通过刺激腺苷释放导致了困意增加，从而形成从觉醒到睡眠的转换。 此外，除了神经元可以作用于睡眠过程，星形胶质细胞等神经支撑系统同样在视交叉上核（SCN）节律形成过程中起着不可忽视的作用，星形胶质细胞可以通过释放腺苷促进睡眠，并在睡眠期间，通过淋巴途径清洁大脑。 目前我们对于大多数睡眠障碍并没有特效疗法，一个主要的原因就是我们对大脑调控睡眠-觉醒机制的理解还不够透彻。比如，对睡眠的内稳态系统起到了调节作用的腺苷，虽然已知其和多个脑区有关，包括基底前脑、乳头结节核、下丘脑外侧核和伏隔核在内的许多脑区，但参与腺苷促睡眠作用的脑内完整神经回路仍不清楚。从这个角度上讲，研究“睡眠-觉醒是如何被调控的”这一问题。具有重要的临床意义和社会价值。 声明：脑医汇旗下神外资讯、神介资讯、神内资讯、脑医咨询、Ai Brain 所发表内容之知识产权为脑医汇及主办方、原作者等相关权利人所有。",

              "content": "Abstract Sleep is a highly conserved phenomenon in endotherms, and has a universal physiological function across all species. In mammals, sleep can be divided into two stages: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep, which alternate in a cyclic manner. Humans spend about one-third of their lives asleep. Sufficient sleep is necessary for humans to sustain everyday functioning. Sleep plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism, immune defense, endocrine function, and the consolidation of memory process. With the development of social economy and the change of life style, sleep duration of the residents has gradually decreased and the incidence of sleep disturbances has increased. Sleep disturbances can lead to severe mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, dementia, and other mental diseases, and may increase the risk of physical diseases, such as chronic inflammation, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and others. Maintaining good sleep is of great significance for developing social productive forces, promoting sustainable development of economic society, and is a necessary condition for carrying out the \"Healthy China Strategy\". The sleep research in China started in 1950s. After decades of development, researchers have made great progress in the molecular mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, the pathogenesis of sleep disorders and the development of new therapies. With the advancement of science and technology and the public's attention to sleep, the level of clinical diagnosis and therapy of sleep disorders in China is gradually brought in line with international standards. The publication of diagnosis and treatment guidelines in the field of sleep medicine will promote the standardization of the construction. In the future, it is still necessary to promote the development of sleep medicine in the following aspects: Strengthening the professional training and discipline construction, improving the cooperation of sleep research, promoting the intelligent diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, and developing the new intervention strategies. Therefore, this review will comprehensively summarize the origin, current situation, and future expectations of sleep medicine in China, including discipline construction of sleep medicine, the number of sleep project grants, research findings, the status and progress of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, and the development direction of sleep medicine. Keywords: Sleep medicine, Sleep disorders, China, Research progress 睡眠是生物进化过程中最基本的生命过程，占据人生约三分之一的时间，是人类生活最重要的组成部分[1]。人类睡眠主要分为快速眼动(rapid eye movement，REM)睡眠和非快速眼动(non-rapid eye movement，NREM)睡眠，以大约90~100 min为一个周期出现NREM睡眠到REM睡眠的交替循环[2]。睡眠对机体能量代谢、免疫调节、内分泌及脑功能活动等生理机能发挥重要调控作用，良好的睡眠有助于促进体力和精力恢复、提高记忆力和增强抵抗力，是个体生存发展的基础[3-4]。 随着社会经济的发展和生活方式的转变，居民睡眠时间逐渐减少，睡眠问题发生率逐渐增高。新型冠状病毒肺炎(新冠肺炎)疫情的爆发进一步加重了睡眠问题。一项纳入近50万人的荟萃分析指出，新冠肺炎疫情期间全球大众睡眠问题的发生率高达40.5%[5]。我们团队开展的一项横断面调查发现，新冠肺炎疫情期间我国公众失眠发生率高达29.2%[6]。长期失眠可能会导致睡眠障碍的发生，睡眠障碍是一系列与睡眠相关疾病的统称，包含失眠障碍、睡眠呼吸障碍等。睡眠障碍的高发生率给个人、家庭和社会都造成了沉重负担[7]。另外，睡眠障碍可能会导致抑郁障碍、焦虑障碍等精神心理疾病的发生，也可能会增加心脏病、糖尿病、高血压等躯体疾病的发生风险或加重其病情[8-10]。因此，睡眠医学研究是脑科学领域的前沿问题和关系全民健康的关键问题。《健康中国行动(2019—2030年)》提倡成人每日平均睡眠时间要达到7~8 h[11]。维持良好的睡眠对提高国民健康水平和社会生产力、促进经济和社会可持续发展具有重要意义，是实现健康中国的必要条件。 我国睡眠研究起始于20世纪50年代，经过几十年的发展，在睡眠-觉醒机制、睡眠障碍发病机制与治疗手段开发等多方面取得了诸多重大进展。随着科学技术的发展及公众对睡眠的重视，睡眠障碍的临床诊疗水平也逐渐与国际接轨。2014年有文章综述了中国睡眠医学的过去、现在与未来，主要涉及睡眠医学学科发展现状及问题等[12]。本文将着重对我国睡眠医学研究现状及发展进行全面综述。 1. 我国现代睡眠医学的起源 20世纪初期，德国精神病学家Hans Berger首次在人类头皮上记录到脑电活动[13]，这一发现极大推动了世界睡眠医学的发展。20世纪70年代，欧美等发达国家对睡眠疾病日益重视，睡眠研究逐渐增多，睡眠研究会和睡眠中心等专业机构也相继建立。我国睡眠医学研究萌芽于20世纪50年代，河南医科大学王若雨教授率先开展睡眠基础理论研究工作，受限于历史环境等因素，研究进展缓慢[12]。随后二三十年里，我国睡眠医学研究主要以翻译国外研究成果、综述和著作为主[14-15]。至20世纪80年代，我国睡眠医学研究才逐渐开始发展。1981年，刘协和教授在四川医学院精神病学研究室创建了我国精神科第一个多导睡眠监测实验室，在国内率先开展了一系列睡眠障碍相关的研究，探索了不同精神疾病的睡眠特点。1986年，黄席珍教授在北京协和医院建立了国内第一家睡眠呼吸障碍诊疗中心。随后一年，中国科学院上海生命科学研究院刘世熠教授开始筹建中国睡眠研究会，该研究会于1994年正式成立。 1988年，第一项有关睡眠疾病的研究在国家自然科学基金项目中立项，资助金额仅有1.5万元。2009年9月国家自然科学基金委员会医学科学部成立，并专门设立“睡眠呼吸障碍”(代码为H0113)和“睡眠与睡眠障碍”(代码为H0916)两个亚方向用以资助睡眠研究。项目数量、类型及资助金额都有了大幅提升，极大促进了我国睡眠医学研究的全面发展。与此同时，北京大学医学部及附属医院在睡眠医学研究领域进行了很多积极的尝试。自2009年起，北京大学医学部形成了有关睡眠医学学科研究的战略设想及计划，探讨从医疗和研究的联合，到人员和机构的整合。综上，在众多专家和学者的不懈努力下，我国睡眠医学在上个世纪实现了从无到有的飞跃，开启了睡眠医学研究的新篇章。 2. 我国睡眠医学发展现状 2.1. 睡眠医学学科建设 睡眠医学是一门综合交叉学科，涉及精神科、神经科、呼吸科、耳鼻喉科、心血管科等多个学科，睡眠与精神疾病或心脑血管等多种重大慢性疾病有密切关联[16-17]，其重要性日益显现。目前，全国已有大量医院或高校建立了睡眠中心、睡眠监测室、睡眠研究室或睡眠门诊等，均依托于精神科、神经内科、呼吸科、耳鼻喉科或头颈外科等专业，各专业设立的睡眠研究室侧重于本专业疾病。为了促进睡眠医学多学科交叉融合，2014年北京大学医学部在陆林院士的主导下率先开设了“睡眠医学”的研究生课程，主要讲授常见睡眠障碍的发病机制、诊断及治疗、国内外睡眠医学的发展现状和睡眠研究技术与方法，以促进学生对睡眠医学基本理论、睡眠障碍发病机制和治疗原则等知识的理解和掌握。随后，国内多所高校也相继将“睡眠医学”课程纳入研究生培养方案中。国家卫生健康委员会“十三五”住院医师规范化培训第二轮规划教材新增《睡眠医学》。 目前欧美国家已将睡眠医学发展为独立学科，我国起步稍晚。世界卫生组织公布的《国际疾病分类第十一次修订本(ICD-11)》中将“睡眠-觉醒障碍”单独列为一章，彰显了睡眠疾病的独立性与重要性。世界卫生组织国际分类家族中国合作中心、中华医学会及有关医疗机构专家对ICD-11进行了编译，形成了《国际疾病分类第十一次修订本(ICD-11)中文版》。2019年6月，中国医师协会发布了《专科医师规范化培训专科目录(2019年版)》，睡眠医学正式被纳入培训目录名单，在住院医师规范化培训中，睡眠医学成为了主要培训内容，表明睡眠医学在国内将成为独立学科，与心血管等学科并列归属于内科，此举极大促进了睡眠医学从业人员交叉学科知识的培养和诊疗水平的提高。 2.2. 睡眠项目立项情况 近十年来，我国睡眠医学蓬勃发展，取得了长足进步。睡眠研究领域的项目立项数量和资助金额逐年增多，以国家自然科学基金为例，立项总数从1988—2009年的46项增加为2010—2019年的353项，资助总金额也从1988—2009年的1 076万元增加为2010—2019年的15 334.05万元[18]。2015年，由北京大学第六医院陆林院士牵头的我国首个睡眠研究领域国家重点基础研究发展计划(973计划)——“睡眠脑功能及其机制研究”获得科技部的立项，该项目以阐明睡眠脑功能及其机制、揭示睡眠的本质为总体目标，极大程度推动了我国睡眠医学的发展。2021年，科技创新2030“脑科学与类脑研究”重大项目(即“中国脑计划”)立项多个睡眠医学研究项目，包括睡眠与节律调节的神经机制、睡眠障碍的发病机制及干预技术研究等[19]，将进一步促进睡眠脑功能机制的全面解析及睡眠障碍诊疗水平的提高。 2.3. 睡眠领域突破性研究进展 在睡眠研究项目的资助下，近十年我国学者发表的睡眠研究文章数量逐年增加。以“sleep”和“China”为主题词在Web of Science网站检索发现，年发表文章数量从2011年的131篇增长至2021年的1 124篇。在睡眠-觉醒的生理机制、睡眠与认知、睡眠障碍与神经精神疾病及躯体疾病的关系及机制研究等多方面都取得了突破性进展。 2.3.1. 睡眠觉醒机制 近几年，我国学者在睡眠-觉醒的分子、细胞和环路机制等方面均取得了突破性的研究成果。陆军军医大学胡志安教授团队发现在睡眠-觉醒转换过程中，丘脑室旁核(paraventricular thalamus，PVT)的谷氨酸能神经元在清醒时表现出高活性，抑制PVT神经元的活性可导致觉醒减少，激活PVT神经元则可实现从睡眠到觉醒的转换[20]。该发现为嗜睡等疾病的治疗提供了新的干预靶点。复旦大学黄志力教授团队发现了伏隔核多巴胺(dopamine，DA)D1受体阳性神经元活性与觉醒高度相关，通过抑制中脑腹侧背盖区和外侧下丘脑中γ-氨基丁酸(γ-aminobutyric acid，GABA)能中间神经元，使DA能神经元和食欲素神经元去抑制，实现对觉醒行为的调控[21]。进一步研究发现由GABA能神经元组成的脑干结构——吻内侧被盖核在NREM睡眠的启动和维持中发挥重要作用，该脑区向中脑DA能神经元有广泛的纤维投射，促进NREM睡眠，并参与了睡眠内稳态的调控[22]。研究还证实了伏隔核-腹侧苍白球-中脑腹侧被盖区为调控动机行为和觉醒的神经环路，以及下丘脑室旁核对觉醒的调控作用[23-24]。以上研究为失眠障碍及相关疾病的临床治疗提供了新思路和潜在治疗靶点。浙江大学医学院郭方教授团队采用跨突触显示、钙成像等技术发现名为AOTU的脑区，它们支配着一群特殊的TuBu神经元，与睡眠稳态中心——椭球体EB-R2耦联，从而起到调节睡眠-觉醒转换的作用[25]。该研究为阐述昼夜节律环路和睡眠环路的连接机制提供了非常重要的依据。 2.3.2. 睡眠机制研究新技术 对神经递质浓度变化的快速特异性追踪为睡眠机制的探索起到了重要的推动作用。近年来，北京大学李毓龙教授团队开发了一系列具备高灵敏度和高细胞特异性的神经递质检测方法，对乙酰胆碱、DA、去甲肾上腺素(norepinephrine，NE)等在睡眠过程中发挥重要作用的神经递质进行了特异荧光探针的开发和优化。例如，开发了基于G蛋白偶联受体激活的乙酰胆碱探针，对乙酰胆碱的检测灵敏度可达到微摩尔浓度，实现了对乙酰胆碱的动态监测[26]；开发了DA探针，包括DA1m与DA1h两种，实现了对DA的亚细胞分辨率与亚秒级别动力学特性的检测，且具有良好的分子特异性[27]；基于人源NE受体开发了两种具有不同亲和力的探针，分别适用于指示NE的局部传递或体积传递，实现在体对NE与DA进行区分[28]。上述新型神经递质检测工具具有可遗传编码、高灵敏性、高特异性、快速的动力学反应等优势，为探索神经递质如何影响睡眠-觉醒提供了不可或缺的工具。 2.3.3. 睡眠与学习记忆 睡眠对于个体的学习记忆、决策、情绪加工等大脑高级认知功能的维持至关重要[3]。北京大学时杰教授团队和朱露莎教授团队合作发现，睡眠过程中唤起与价值信息相关的食物名称，可以促进食物价值信息的巩固，使得个体在觉醒后更容易提取与这些零食相关的正性价值信息，这表明睡眠期间的线索诱导过程可以灵活、有选择性地调节主观偏好[29]。该研究为在无意识状态下改变个体的不良饮食习惯(如挑食、厌食等行为)提供了新方向。北京师范大学秦绍正教授课题组和深圳大学吴佳慧教授课题组研究发现，负性情绪记忆习得后的睡眠使负性情绪记忆增强，更不容易被消除[30]，该研究为创伤后应激障碍(posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD)等疾病的治疗策略制定提供了新思路。睡眠中的行为学干预也会影响记忆的表达和维持，北京大学第六医院陆林院士团队发现，慢波睡眠中条件性刺激的再暴露可以促进恐惧记忆的消退[31]，该研究得到了国际睡眠医学领域专家的高度肯定，为以病理性恐惧记忆为基础的疾病提供了一种“睡眠疗法”，具有潜在的临床应用价值。 2.3.4. 睡眠障碍与神经精神疾病 失眠障碍和呼吸相关睡眠障碍是最常见的睡眠障碍，且两者共病率较高，研究发现在呼吸相关睡眠障碍患者中失眠障碍的比例高达38%，失眠障碍患者中呼吸相关睡眠障碍也达到35%[32]。发作性睡病和不宁腿综合征也是常见的睡眠障碍，四川大学华西医院唐向东教授团队研究发现儿童发作性睡病患者较成人患者夜间觉醒更多，睡眠片段化更严重[33]。我们课题组荟萃分析发现，全球范围内孕期不宁腿综合征的患病率为21%，但在不同地区孕期不宁腿综合征的患病率不一致，欧洲地区为23%，西太平洋地区为11%，东地中海地区为30%，美洲地区为23%，且孕期不宁腿综合征的患病率随孕周延长而增大[34]。上述研究为了解睡眠障碍的患病率及疾病特征提供了全面且直观的数据，有助于相关政策的制定和疾病防治。睡眠障碍与多种神经精神疾病的发生密切相关[16]。北京大学第六医院陆林院士团队针对睡眠与痴呆的关系进行了全面的分析，发现睡眠障碍是痴呆发生的危险因素，不同类型的睡眠障碍在不同种类痴呆的发生和发展过程中扮演的角色不同：失眠障碍是阿尔兹海默症(Alzheimer’s disease，AD)发生的危险因素；呼吸相关睡眠障碍可同时增加AD和血管性痴呆的发生[35]，该研究提示痴呆相关的睡眠改变可作为早期干预痴呆的切入点，通过改善患者的睡眠以期减缓认知下降。四川大学华西医院唐向东教授团队开展荟萃分析发现，AD患者的慢波睡眠比例减少与痴呆严重度相关。在AD患者中观察到脑电图频率成分和睡眠纺锤波的改变，该变化可能是与AD诊断相关的生物标志物[36]。但睡眠-觉醒异常引起认知功能受损的病理机制目前尚不清楚，除中枢神经系统的调节外，肠道菌群也逐渐进入研究视野。我们的一项研究发现睡眠剥夺可导致人体肠道内短链脂肪酸的代谢水平改变，这种代谢改变可影响神经炎症水平，该研究首次从“微生物-肠-脑轴”角度揭示了睡眠剥夺导致认知受损的机制，为理解睡眠剥夺与神经炎症的关系提供了新的视角[37]。此外，唐向东教授团队还分析了多种神经精神疾病患者的睡眠结构特点，发现PTSD患者总睡眠时间和慢波睡眠减少，睡眠效率降低，且PTSD严重程度与睡眠效率和慢波睡眠百分比降低有关[38]。另一项荟萃分析发现，帕金森病患者的总睡眠时间、睡眠效率、NREM 2期百分比、慢波睡眠、REM睡眠百分比显著减少，表明相较于对照组，帕金森病患者的睡眠质量较差[39]。上述系列研究表明，睡眠紊乱可作为神经精神疾病发生和发展的重要生物学标志，具有潜在的临床诊断价值，进一步阐明了睡眠与神经精神疾病的关系。 2.3.5. 睡眠障碍与躯体疾病 我国研究者还深入探索了睡眠与心血管疾病之间的关系，香港中文大学荣润国教授团队开展了一项纳入UK Biobank数据库404 044人的研究，分析了睡眠时长与12种心血管疾病之间的因果关系，发现睡眠时长与高血压、房颤、肺栓塞和慢性缺血性心脏病呈负相关，提示睡眠时长过短(≤6 h)是高血压、房颤、肺栓塞和慢性缺血性心脏病的潜在风险因素[40]。唐向东教授团队发现失眠患者白天的觉醒过度可显著增加高血压的患病风险[41]。随后，通过客观评估阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征(obstructive sleep apnea，OSA)患者的睡眠，发现其生理觉醒水平降低(即嗜睡)与高血压患病风险增加相关[42]，这一发现与该团队此前对失眠症患者的研究结果相反。唐教授团队进一步评估了慢波睡眠在OSA和高血压中的关系，发现慢波睡眠减少和OSA的相互作用增加了慢性高血压发生的概率[43]。上述研究不仅反映了睡眠障碍与心血管疾病之间的复杂关系，也为进一步探索相关机制与干预策略提供了新的线索。睡眠障碍与代谢类疾病的发生也有密切关系，上海市第六人民医院殷善开教授团队发现OSA与糖代谢异常有关，睡眠碎片化与高胰岛素血症独立相关，间歇性低氧与高血糖、高胰岛素血症和异常的胰岛素抵抗稳态模型评估独立相关[44]；该团队还发现脂代谢紊乱与OSA严重程度之间存在阶段异质性，提示应采用一种新的预测策略动态评估临床中OSA的风险进展[45]。中国台湾研究者对比分析了4 000余名不育男性和18 000余名对照者，发现OSA与不育风险增加有关[46]。以上系列研究为阐明睡眠障碍与躯体疾病的关系发挥了重大推动作用。 2.3.6. 睡眠障碍干预策略研发 与此同时，我国学者也在积极研发治疗失眠障碍的新型药物，例如，GABAα受体拮抗剂EVT-201胶囊已完成Ⅲ期临床试验，食欲素双受体拮抗剂莱博雷生、盐酸多塞平口颊膜片、YZJ-1139片、琥珀酸多西拉敏片、坤怡宁颗粒等正在进行Ⅲ期临床试验，马来酸咪达唑仑片、右佐匹克隆片、酒石酸唑吡坦片、佐匹克隆片、苯巴比妥片、艾司唑仑片等多种药物已完成人体生物等效性试验(http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/index.html)。目前，治疗过度嗜睡的新药替洛利生也正在开展临床试验。神经调控技术也被逐渐应用于睡眠医学领域，如经颅磁刺激、经颅直流电刺激、经颅交流电刺激等[47]。首都医科大学宣武医院王玉平教授团队在慢性失眠人群中开展了一项随机双盲临床试验，发现经颅交流电刺激治疗后，失眠患者的匹兹堡睡眠质量指数总分显著降低，睡眠效率提高，睡眠质量改善[48]。此外，经耳迷走神经刺激、生物反馈治疗、光照治疗等也在睡眠医学领域有广泛的应用前景。 2.4. 我国睡眠疾病诊疗现状及进展 近年来，我国学者在推动睡眠疾病诊疗能力提升方面也做出突出贡献，制定了多种睡眠障碍诊疗指南或专家共识，主要有《中国失眠障碍综合防治指南》《中国失眠障碍诊断和治疗指南》《中国成人失眠伴抑郁焦虑诊治专家共识》《中国儿童阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停诊断与治疗指南(2020)》《中国发作性睡病诊断与治疗指南》《不宁腿综合征的诊断标准和治疗指南》等。睡眠疾病指南和专家共识的建立将有助于提升我国睡眠医生的诊疗能力。2021年我国首部《中国睡眠医学中心标准化建设指南》正式出版，从多学科睡眠医学中心的人员建设、场地建设及硬件设施建设、睡眠障碍的规范化诊疗等多方面进行了全面介绍，该指南既有利于睡眠诊疗工作的进一步规范，也将促进我国睡眠医学的规范化建设与发展。 3. 我国睡眠医学发展方向 3.1. 加强睡眠医学专业人才培养及学科建设 将睡眠医学作为一门独立的学科体系是保障睡眠医学发展和睡眠专业人才培养的必要途径。目前，我国从事睡眠相关疾病诊疗工作的医务人员大多为精神科、神经内科、呼吸科等学科背景，对睡眠疾病的识别常从各自专业背景出发，存在一定的学科偏向性。因此，未来仍需大力促进不同学科之间的交叉合作，推动睡眠医学的规范化培训，促进跨学科人员对睡眠交叉知识的掌握和了解，推进跨学科诊疗指南的制订。相较于欧美国家完善的继续教育培训和资格考试制度，我国目前对睡眠技术人员的认证考核机制尚不健全，亟需开展睡眠技术规范化培训和认证体系建设，同时，医院和政府也应加大政策实施力度和经费投入，完善执业考核机制和继续教育机制，以更好地促进临床睡眠医学专业人才队伍的建设与发展。 3.2. 健全睡眠研究协作机制 近年来，随着全国各地睡眠研究机构的逐步建立，各研究中心收集的睡眠数据逐渐累积，但是却存在数据形式多样和数据管理不便等问题。将来需要各地区加强合作，探索睡眠医学协同创新体系新方向，建立全国多地区协作的睡眠研究体系，协同攻关，优势互补，实现系统性整合优化；搭建规范化、标准化、整合多维度指标的睡眠相关数据库及研究平台；强化多学科交叉，建立预测、诊疗和康复的多模态单共病一体化的信息挖掘方法，开创睡眠医学研究的新模式。 3.3. 促进睡眠医学诊疗智能化 随着人工智能和传感技术的发展，如今的医学诊疗模式正在向智能化方向发展。美国睡眠医学会发布意见书推荐睡眠远程医疗技术，即利用互联网和实时视频传输等方法对患者进行诊疗[49]。在新冠肺炎疫情期间，我国睡眠医学互联网诊疗已经得到一定程度的发展，如逐渐兴起的在线失眠认知行为治疗。未来睡眠诊疗服务应进一步结合人工智能等先进技术，在提高患者依从性的同时，提升智能化远程诊疗模式的诊疗效果，最终推动个人睡眠健康监测系统、智慧医院和区域睡眠管理平台的建设，满足人民日益增长的睡眠健康需求。但智能化远程诊疗模式的诊疗效果、患者依从性等仍需密切关注与评估，这一新兴医疗模式的发展依旧任重道远。 3.4. 推动睡眠机制解析和睡眠障碍干预新策略研发 2013年Nature发表文章提出“人类睡眠计划”，旨在通过多学科协作的方式发展新型干预手段，改善睡眠健康状况，提高生命质量[50]。随着2021年“中国脑计划”正式启动[19]，未来我国研究者将在睡眠-觉醒机制、睡眠节律、睡眠研究新技术、睡眠与学习记忆等多方面进一步开展系统深入的研究。同时，在国家级脑疾病临床研究大数据与样本库平台的支持下，我国将建立覆盖全生命周期的睡眠及睡眠障碍大样本数据库，结合基因组学、影像组学、计算神经科学、行为科学和生物信息学等方法深入探索睡眠的脑功能机制；融合多种神经监测与调控技术，全面解析睡眠障碍的发病机制；挖掘睡眠障碍的生物标志物和特异性干预靶点，加快新型药物研发；研发可穿戴式预警装置，从而建立标准化、个体化的睡眠监测和干预体系，实现对睡眠障碍的早期诊断和早期干预。在“中国脑计划”的引领下，我国学者有望在睡眠医学领域取得重大研究突破，以推动我国睡眠医学的飞跃发展。 4. 结语 目前，我国睡眠医学事业正处于蓬勃发展阶段，国家政府的大力支持、高水平科研机构的建立和专业人才队伍的积累，使我国在睡眠医学领域取得了一系列重要的研究成果，也显著提高了我国针对睡眠障碍的诊疗服务能力。但我们也应认清当下我国睡眠医学仍需要进一步发展。“中国脑计划”的启动为睡眠医学研究提供了良好的契机，并将推动睡眠医学走向更加光辉的未来。 Funding Statement

              "content": "膳食与睡眠的关联研究 睡眠-膳食关系 健康的两个内在因素是膳食和睡眠。这两种行为很可能相互影响：睡眠不足对饮食摄入量的负面影响；富含褪黑素和色氨酸的水果、蔬菜、豆类等膳食也可以改善睡眠质量。大量数据表明，这些生活方式因素之间存在循环关系。我们建议采用健康的膳食来改善睡眠，同时这也会进一步促进持续良好的膳食习惯。 睡眠健康状况不佳如今已成为日益严重的公共卫生问题，因为睡眠不足和睡眠质量不佳一直与肥胖、2型糖尿病、心血管疾病等慢性代谢性疾病的高发病风险相关。同时，膳食的数量与质量也影响着心血管疾病和其他代谢性疾病，这也是慢性病管理中生活方式干预的重点。 然而根据目前的流行病学证据，是不能判断睡眠时间/质量与膳食之间关系的方向性的，因此来自哥伦比亚大学欧文医学中心的Faris M. Zuraikat等人在《Annual Review of Nutrition》杂志发表高质量综述文章，来评估成年人睡眠-膳食关系的周期性。研究者们首先概述了睡眠不足对膳食摄入量的不利影响，同时强调摄入健康食物和较高的整体膳食质量可以改善睡眠，并阐明了膳食营养素影响睡眠健康的生物学途径。随后，文章通过回顾流行病学研究和临床干预研究，评估特定食物和膳食模式对睡眠质量的影响。最后，研究者们提出了这一领域未来的研究方向，并强调了睡眠-饮食双向关系对公共健康的影响。 图1 Faris M. Zuraikat等人近期在《Annual Review of Nutrition》杂志发表《Sleep and Diet: Mounting Evidence of a Cyclical Relationship》 睡眠对膳食的影响 研究者小组首先通过Meta分析研究睡眠对膳食摄入量的影响，结果证实：与充足的习惯性睡眠相比，睡眠限制(每晚睡眠时间<5.5小时)会增加能量摄入量。同时也有证据表明，由于睡眠不足而消耗的食物种类发生了变化：增加饱和脂肪、碳水化合物的消耗，并增加零食摄入，即睡眠减少会降低整体膳食质量。导致膳食摄入量因睡眠时间减少而发生的变化的机制包括：由于清醒时间延长而增加进食机会，食欲调节因子(瘦素、胃泌素、脂联素、胰高血糖素样肽1和食欲素等)的改变；增加对食物奖励的敏感度，以及味觉或知觉的改变(图2a)。越来越多有力的证据表明，睡眠的改善可能会改善膳食种类的选择和摄入量。因此，改善睡眠质量和持续时间的建议可能具有重要的公共卫生意义。 图2 睡眠-饮食的双向关系 膳食对睡眠的影响 在探究膳食摄入量对睡眠的影响时，首先从生物学基础出发，分析褪黑素和5-羟色胺在睡眠调节中的作用：褪黑素认为是睡眠-清醒周期的主要调节激素，褪黑激素的分泌遵循昼夜节律模式，白天水平较低，晚上开始上升，以促进睡眠；5-羟色胺是一种神经递质，可能参与睡眠-清醒的动态平衡过程，能够标志着清醒的持续时间和强度，同时5-羟色胺还参与了褪黑素生物合成途径，具有促进睡眠的作用。内源性褪黑素只由膳食色氨酸产生，而摄入碳水化合物和富含色氨酸的食物可以促进色氨酸进入大脑，从而促进5-羟色胺和褪黑素的生物合成（图2b）。由此，可以从生物学上证明食物影响睡眠质量是合理的，即富含5-羟色胺和褪黑素的食物可能对睡眠有积极影响。同时大量的动物和人群实验证实，富含色氨酸、5-羟色胺和褪黑素的食品对各种睡眠参数具有良好的改善效果。 在研究膳食因素对睡眠健康的影响时，更应考虑膳食的整体作用效果。依据以上的理论基础证据，膳食模式影响的睡眠的关键机制是色氨酸与中性氨基酸（决定了大脑摄取色氨酸的水平）以及碳水化合物的消耗。有证据表明能够改善睡眠参数的膳食模式，首先是低升糖指数（GI）膳食能够导致摄入更少的碳水化合物，从而有益于良好的睡眠质量。其次是地中海饮食模式(MedDiet)，其特点是大量摄取水果、坚果和全谷物，这些都是褪黑素的显著来源)，还有鱼、橄榄油、红酒，以及有限的乳制品、家禽和红肉，大量的横断面研究与纵向队列研究表明更好地坚持MedDiet可能有助于改善睡眠质量，或降低发展或恶化睡眠紊乱模式的风险。同样有研究报道其他与睡眠有关的膳食模式，如控制高血压膳食模式（DASH）与低炎症指数（DII）膳食，认为其可以通过与更高的MedDiet依从性和更低的饮食GI类似的方式实现对睡眠的改善作用。 如何促进睡眠质量 睡眠时间短、睡眠质量差和失眠越来越被认为是心脏代谢性疾病的危险因素，各国公共卫生机构和基金会发表共识声明，鼓励制定和评估改善睡眠的策略，强调了膳食模式作为一种可改变的生活方式因素的潜在作用，可以用来改善睡眠健康，也揭示了未来研究的关键途径。 促进睡眠健康的循证建议是鼓励个人增加水果（如猕猴桃、樱桃、西红柿、草莓）、蔬菜、坚果（如杏仁和核桃）、豆类和其他低热量食物（如全谷物）的摄入量，并包括鱼和其他瘦肉动物蛋白来源，所有这些都是MedDiet和其他健康饮食模式的标志性食物。除了丰富的睡眠来源、促进营养和改善睡眠外，这些食物还对心脏代谢健康有多种益处，可以进一步提高睡眠质量。这些建议的目标是摆脱睡眠不佳的恶性循环，促使人们消费不良的饮食，进一步推动睡眠不良和整体健康，走向健康的饮食模式促进良好睡眠并降低慢性病风险的良性循环。 作者介绍 李颖教授/博导，哈尔滨医科大学公共卫生学院副院长，中国营养学会微量元素营养分会副主任委员。主要研究方向为微量营养素与营养相关性疾病的分子机制研究,先后主持19项课题，包括国家自然基金，农业部重大专项子课题、“十一五”科技支撑计划子课题、全军后勤科研重大项目子课题等。入选教育部新世纪优秀人才，国家卫生计生委人才交流服务中心全国卫生人才评价领域专家，国家核心期刊《中华预防医学》《中国公共卫生》杂志编委。 参考文献 Zuraikat F M, et al.

              "content": "【睡眠日科普】数字疗法助力改善失眠，降低抑郁 编者按 2025年3月21日是第25个世界睡眠日，今年的主题为“健康睡眠，优先之选”。 本期的北医人爱科普“睡眠日专题”聚焦睡眠与心理健康的密切关系，特邀精神医学与睡眠医学家陆林院士为我们答疑解惑。 陆林 精神医学与睡眠医学家 中国科学院院士 睡不好，心更累 Q失眠既是抑郁症的诱因，也是其症状之一。您能详细讲解一下它们之间的相互作用机制吗？ 抑郁症是全球12亿青年人口中最常见的精神疾病之一，而失眠与抑郁之间存在着密切的关系，失眠是抑郁症发病的独立危险因素。失眠与抑郁症之间存在复杂的双向关系，彼此相互影响并可能形成恶性循环。 从生理机制来看，长期失眠会导致大脑神经递质失衡，特别是与情绪调节相关的5-羟色胺（5-HT）、去甲肾上腺素（NE）和多巴胺（DA）。这些递质的失衡会降低大脑对压力的适应能力，使个体更容易产生负面情绪，增加抑郁症的风险。此外，失眠还会引发下丘脑-垂体-肾上腺轴（HPA轴）的过度激活，导致皮质醇水平升高，进一步加剧焦虑和情绪低落。 从心理与行为机制来看，抑郁症患者由于情绪调控功能受损，往往难以入睡或维持高质量睡眠。例如，他们可能会因为过度思考消极事件而难以入眠，或因深度睡眠减少而频繁夜间觉醒。这种睡眠质量的下降又会进一步恶化情绪状态，使个体陷入“睡眠障碍-情绪低落-失眠更严重”的恶性循环。 六大科学建议助你改善睡眠 Q在日常生活中，您对普通公众改善睡眠、预防失眠及抑郁症有什么科学建议？尤其是对高压力、高节奏的年轻人群？ 在快节奏、高压力的现代社会，睡眠质量的下降已成为影响青年人身心健康的重要因素。为了改善睡眠并降低失眠相关的抑郁风险，我们建议： 1.建立规律作息：每天固定时间入睡和起床，避免熬夜或周末过度补觉，以维持稳定的生物钟。 2.优化睡眠环境：保持卧室安静、黑暗、适宜的温度，减少蓝光干扰，可适度使用助眠工具如遮光窗帘、白噪音机或香薰（如薰衣草）。 3.减少睡前刺激：睡前一小时避免使用电子设备、高强度脑力活动或摄入咖啡因、酒精等刺激物，可进行放松训练，如冥想、深呼吸或温水泡脚。 4.管理压力和情绪：规律运动（如瑜伽、快走）、保持社交联系，并使用正念练习来缓解焦虑，提高心理韧性。 5.科学饮食与运动：晚餐避免过量油腻或辛辣食物，可适量摄入富含色氨酸的食物（如牛奶、香蕉），促进褪黑素分泌。同时，避免临睡前剧烈运动，以免影响入睡。 6.适时寻求帮助：若失眠持续4周以上，或伴随明显情绪低落，应及时寻求专业心理咨询或医学干预，避免问题进一步恶化。 研究表明，失眠与抑郁关系密切。北京大学第六医院陆林院士团队与香港中文大学医学院联合开展了亚洲首项数字化失眠认知行为治疗（简称数字化CBT-I）的临床研究，提示此程序可降低青年失眠患者抑郁症发病率。此项研究已刊载于国际顶尖医学期刊《PLoS Medicine》。 影响亚洲年轻人睡眠的社会文化因素 Q与欧美国家相比，亚洲年轻人的失眠状况是否更为突出？这是否与生活方式、文化或社会环境相关？ 目前尚无充分证据表明亚洲年轻人的失眠状况一定比欧美国家更为突出，但亚洲年轻人的失眠问题确实值得关注。亚洲年轻人面临着一些独特的生活方式、文化和社会环境因素，这些因素可能对他们的失眠状况产生影响。 从生活方式来看，亚洲年轻人普遍面临着较大的学业和就业压力，学习和工作时间较长，生活节奏较快，导致睡眠时间被压缩。此外，现代科技的普及，如智能手机、电脑等电子产品的广泛使用，也使得年轻人的睡眠受到干扰。研究表明，过度使用电子产品与失眠之间存在显著相关性，而亚洲年轻人对电子产品的依赖程度较高，这可能是导致失眠的一个重要因素。 从文化角度来看，亚洲文化中存在着一些对睡眠的误解和忽视。例如，在一些文化中，熬夜被视为努力工作的象征，早睡则被认为是懒惰的表现。这种文化观念可能导致年轻人忽视睡眠的重要性，从而增加失眠的风险。此外，亚洲家庭中普遍存在着较高的期望和压力，这也可能对年轻人的心理健康和睡眠产生负面影响。 从社会环境方面来说，亚洲社会的快速变化和发展，使得年轻人面临着更多的不确定性和竞争压力。经济压力、就业竞争、社会阶层固化等因素，都可能导致年轻人产生焦虑和抑郁情绪，进而影响睡眠质量。与欧美国家相比，亚洲社会的福利保障体系相对不够完善，年轻人在面对生活压力时可能缺乏足够的支持和缓冲，这也可能是导致失眠问题的一个原因。 总之，虽然不能简单地断言亚洲年轻人的失眠状况一定比欧美国家更为突出，但亚洲年轻人确实面临着一些独特的生活方式、文化和社会环境因素，这些因素可能对他们的失眠状况产生影响。因此，我们应重视亚洲年轻人的失眠问题，并采取针对性的措施加以干预，以改善他们的睡眠质量和心理健康状况。 数字CBT-I研究揭示失眠干预新路径 Q什么是数字化CBT-I？ 数字化失眠认知行为治疗（数字化CBT-I）是一种基于互联网和移动设备的失眠干预程序。它将传统的认知行为疗法（CBT-I）与数字技术相结合，通过在线平台为患者提供个性化的失眠治疗方案。这种治疗方式包括：睡眠卫生教育、刺激控制、睡眠限制、认知重构等多个模块，患者可以根据自己的情况在平台上进行学习和实践，无需面对面的治疗，具有便捷、高效、可及性强的特点。 Q干预是如何进行的？ 在本次研究中，我们通过一个专门开发的数字化平台，为青年失眠患者提供为期六周的数字化CBT-I干预治疗方案。治疗过程中，患者需要完成一系列的在线课程和练习，包括学习失眠相关的知识、记录睡眠日记、调整睡眠行为等。同时，平台还会提供实时的反馈和指导，帮助患者更好地理解和应用所学的内容。在整个干预过程中，患者可以随时随地通过手机应用程序进行学习和练习，无需前往医院或诊所，大大提高了治疗的便利性和患者的依从性。 CBTI认知行为治疗操作界面 Q本次研究的成果主要有哪些？ 本次研究取得了令人满意的成果。 首先，数字化CBT-I显著改善了青年失眠及抑郁症状。具体表现为入睡潜伏期、睡眠效率及卧床时间显著改善，昼夜作息及日间疲劳情况有好转，自我评估的抑郁症状也显著减少。 其次，干预后一年的失眠缓解率接近60%，抑郁症发病率与对照组相比大幅下跌42%，干预组的抑郁症发生率只有约10%，而对照组则为18%。 此外，所有参加者完成跟进评估比率为90%，其中干预组完成整个疗程的比率为84%，且无不良事件。 这些结果表明，数字化CBT-I不仅能够有效改善失眠和抑郁症状，还能显著降低抑郁症的发病率，且具有较高的完成率和良好的安全性。 2月20日，北京大学第六医院与香港中文大学在香港联合举办了研究结果新闻发布会。 Q本次研究成果为青年群体提供了新的治疗方式，这种方式未来是否有推广计划？ 本研究的成果表明，基于数字化的失眠认知行为治疗（CBT-I）可有效降低青年失眠患者的抑郁症发病率。由于其线上操作的便捷性，该治疗方式具有较强的可推广性。未来，我们计划通过互联网医疗平台、高校心理健康中心以及医院睡眠门诊推广这一干预手段，使更多青年群体能够便捷地获得科学的睡眠管理服务。 我们建议加强对睡眠健康的公共卫生宣传，提高社会对失眠与心理健康关系的认知，同时推动基层医疗机构配置数字化心理干预工具，使CBT-I等非药物干预手段更广泛地应用于临床实践。 我们建议大家重视睡眠问题，养成良好的作息习惯，并在失眠持续时积极寻求科学的干预方式，如CBT-I，而非依赖安眠药物，以减少长期使用药物带来的副作用。 （来源：北京大学医学部 宣传部 文字、图片由受访专家提供 部分图片源自网络 编辑 / 王景茹 徐璐）",

              "content": "Abstract 失眠障碍是最常见的睡眠障碍之一，且发病率呈现不断增长趋势，带来巨大的经济和社会损失。失眠障碍的治疗主要包括药物治疗和认知行为治疗，药物治疗不良反应多，且易成瘾，目前认知行为治疗为失眠障碍的一线治疗。由于面对面失眠认知行为治疗存在费用高、操作不统一规范等弊端，网络化失眠认知行为治疗逐渐兴起，其治疗效果优于药物治疗，且与面对面失眠认知行为治疗效果相当。本文对失眠认知行为疗法的基本原理和网络化认知行为治疗的发展、形式、疗效以及优缺点进行综述。 Keywords: 网络化, 认知行为治疗, 失眠障碍, 综述 Abstract Insomnia disorder is one of the most common sleep disorders with an increasing incidence to cause substantial economic losses and social burden. The therapy for insomnia disorder mainly includes medication treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy. Medications are associated with various adverse effects and can be easily addictive. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been proposed as the first-line treatment for insomnia disorder. But due to the disadvantages of face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy including a high cost and the lack of standardization, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy has emerged as an alternative with an almost equivalent efficacy to face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy and better effects than medication. This review summarizes the basic principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and discusses the development, forms, effects as well as the advantages and disadvantages of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy. Keywords: internet-based, cognitive behavioral therapy, insomnia disorder, review 失眠障碍是最常见的睡眠障碍之一，全世界有20% ~40%的成人经受失眠的困扰，其中10%~15%已符合失眠障碍的诊断[1]。随着经济发展和生活节奏的不断加快，失眠人群呈现不断增长的趋势。失眠可引起经济和社会的巨大损失，研究显示失眠障碍者的卫生经济学负担为5010美金/人年，而睡眠良好者仅为422美金/人年。此外，失眠障碍带来的间接损失，包括工作效率降低/出勤率降低、收入损失/旷工以及车祸等，明显高于直接损失[2]。 失眠障碍主要表现为入睡困难、睡眠维持困难及早醒，并伴有日间功能受损，根据国际睡眠障碍分类[3]，失眠障碍分为慢性失眠障碍，短期失眠障碍和其他失眠障碍。短期失眠障碍主要与重要的压力源有关，当压力源去除或患者发展出合适的应对机制时，一般可自行缓解，部分患者可因应对模式不良而进展成慢性失眠障碍。 失眠障碍的主要治疗方式为药物治疗、认知行为治疗或两者联合治疗。药物治疗主要包括苯二氮卓类和非苯二氮卓类药物等。药物治疗起效快，短期内可改善入睡潜伏期、夜间觉醒次数、总睡眠时间和睡眠质量等，但目前尚无长期有效的证据。长期使用苯二氮卓类药物会改变睡眠结构，导致患者耐受性和依赖性增加，并出现停药反跳、日间残留效应、认知功能损害以及运动不协调等不良反应，一项病例交叉研究显示短期和长期使用非苯二氮卓类药物与住院老人跌倒风险增加均存在相关性[4]。失眠认知行为疗法（CBT-I）是专门针对失眠的多模式认知行为疗法，它包括认知疗法、行为干预（如睡眠限制和刺激控制）和教育干预（如睡眠卫生教育）。CBT-I对失眠的疗效已在大量研究中得到证实，且不产生与药物类似的不良反应，因此被推荐作为失眠的一线治疗方案[5]。但传统的CBT-I存在过程复杂、经济成本高，经验丰富且训练有素的治疗师有限，且不同治疗师间存在操作差异甚至不规范等缺点，因此，随着计算机和网络技术的快速发展和普及，网络化CBT-I被提出并逐渐受到关注。本文对CBT-I的原理和网络化CBT-I的发展、形式、疗效及优缺点进行综述。 1. CBT-I的原理 Spielman等[6]提出失眠障碍的3P模型，即前置因子、触发因子、维持因子。前置因子是指失眠的先天因素，如完美型人格、易忧虑的个性特征以及先天睡眠系统稳定性差等。触发因子是指直接引起失眠的原因，如生活重大事件、躯体疾病、无法应对的巨大压力等。维持因子是指应对短期失眠所产生的致使睡眠问题持续的不良模式，如入睡前担心睡眠问题、延长卧床时间或引用大量含有咖啡因的饮料等。基于此理论模型，有研究根据美国心理学家Beck建立的由认知理论和行为治疗结合的系统治疗方式，提出了针对失眠的认知行为治疗，包括睡眠卫生教育、认知疗法、睡眠限制疗法、刺激控制疗法、放松疗法[7]。 2. 网络化CBT-I的发展 传统CBT-I是面对面的谈话疗法，治疗师和患者一对一直接接触并提供治疗。由于其无类似药物的副作用，且作用时间持久，成为美国内科医师学会和美国睡眠医学学推荐的金标准。团体CBT-I以一个治疗师与多个患者直接接触方式进行治疗，其疗效也得到研究证实[8]。但是面对面CBT-I存在费用昂贵、过程复杂、经济效益低下、缺乏合格的治疗师等问题，因此，随着互联网的快速普及，网络化CBT-I逐渐得到发展，它突破时间和空间的限制，更加方便灵活和规范统一。 权威性的随机对照实验也证明网络化CBT-I产生的作用大小与传统实施的面对面CBT-I相似[9]，且并不劣于团体CBT-I治疗[10]。有证据表明，即使药物治疗失败，网络化CBT-I仍可改善失眠和相关症状[11]。考虑到互联网本身的使用可能对健康产生积极影响，Kaldo等[12]通过以不包含CBT-I的网络治疗作为对照组解释了这一疑问，对照组通过网络平台学习关于睡眠卫生、放松、压力管理和正念等，但不包括睡眠限制、刺激控制或有关睡眠模式管理的指导性建议，结果提示网络化CBT-I组与对照组相比，睡眠效率明显提高，失眠严重程度也显著降低。 3. 网络化CBT-I的形式及疗效 根据治疗师的参与度，网络化CBT-I主要分为3类，治疗师参与、全自助以及自助+治疗师部分参与，这3类治疗形式的有效性均得到研究的证实。 3.1. 治疗师参与的网络化CBT-I 治疗师会通过一对一的电话或视频聊天方式对患者进行指导，并且全程追踪患者的治疗进度以及睡眠日记、问卷的完成情况，即时提供反馈意见。通过远程视频电话实施的CBT-I可以明显改善患者的睡眠情况以及抑郁、焦虑症状，且疗效在6月后的随访中仍然维持，此外，相较于团体CBT-I和个体面对面CBT-I，通过电话实施的CBT-I疗效无明显差异[13]。一项纳入214例失眠患者的研究[14]显示，远程视频实施的CBT-I能明显改善患者的失眠症状，且该模型已用于发展国家远程医疗计划。 3.2. 全自助的网络化CBT-I 全自助的网络化CBT-I通过构建的网络平台引导患者自主学习相关课程（书籍、小册子、视频、非交互性网站等方式）以及自我练习，并完成睡眠日记和量表评估。国外的网络化CBT-I平台主要有SHUTi、Go!to sleep、Sleepio、CBT-I Coach等。 SHUTi（现已更名为Somryst™）是一个基于网络的结构化程序，旨在治疗成人的失眠症。SHUTi由6周的干预组成，包括25~45 min/周的学习课程、家庭作业以及每日睡眠日记（2~4 min）。课程包括心理教育部分（例如，失眠的危险因素是什么），以及包含吸引用户参与的每周任务演示和详解（视频、测验等）。有随机临床试验证实，与仅接受在线自助睡眠教育的对照组相比，接受网络化CBT-I组的患者失眠严重程度指数、入睡潜伏期、睡后觉醒时间均有明显改善，疗效在1年后依旧维持[15]。但依从性欠佳，仅60.3%的SHUTi患者完成了该程序的6个核心模块。此外，一项权威的随机临床试验研究证实了用于失眠治疗的SHUTi，同时可显著而有效地改善抑郁症状[16]。 Go!to sleep是克利夫兰诊所基于CBT-I开发的为期6周的在线课程，旨在培养更好的睡眠习惯并帮助参与者实施针对失眠策略的认知行为疗法。Go!to sleep每天通过电子邮件提醒用户访问程序，根据前一晚的睡眠情况完成睡眠日志。睡眠日志涉及13个有关睡眠模式的问题，包括入睡潜伏期、总睡眠时间、觉醒次数及醒来时间等。完成睡眠日志后，系统会根据睡眠日志为用户提供个性化反馈，以帮助他们跟踪整个程序的进度。每日有课程或文章，以提供有关失眠的心理教育和有助于解决他们睡眠问题的策略。此外，他们可以通过放松/冥想练习以减少因失眠和压力而引起的精神和生理唤醒。在Bernstein等[17]的研究中，完成6周的课程后，无论是原发性失眠还是共病失眠的患者，其失眠症状都获得明显改善，且4月的随访证实效果仍维持。 Sleepio是一个基于网络且完全自动化的睡眠干预手段，它由6部分组成，包括5节核心技术课程及1节睡眠课程，每节约20 min，每周发布1次。该程序具有很高的互动性，虚拟治疗师引导患者完成每个阶段的内容及家庭作业，并对睡眠日记数据进行计算和分析，同时通过特定的算法将内容个性化以满足患者需求。一项1711例大样本随机临床研究[18]，其对照组通过网络接受睡眠卫生教育，干预组通过Sleepio程序接受在线自助CBT-I，结果显示，与对照组相比，干预组患者在功能健康、心理健康方面以及睡眠相关的生活质量方面均明显改善。在Espie等[19]的研究中，与安慰剂组和空白组相比，Sleepio疗程可帮助约75%慢性失眠患者将睡眠改善至健康水平，且效果在治疗后2月的随访中仍显著。 CBT-I Coach提供睡眠心理教育、跟踪睡眠工具（每日睡眠日记和失眠严重程度指数问卷）以及睡眠卫生建议，包括创造有利的睡眠环境、定期运动并保持健康的饮食习惯等。放松成分包括伴有引导语的图像音频、呼吸训练以及音频引导式的渐进式肌肉放松等。行为计划也可以在程序中进行审查和更新，包括设置提醒何时入睡和起床、完成睡眠日记和失眠严重程度指数评估，以及记录停止摄入咖啡因的时间。有研究证明，APP自助组中的所有参与者接受度好，而非APP自助组中的参与者在治疗结束时介绍给该APP时，他们的响应也较好[20]。这种基于自我管理的移动应用程序，可以成为临床上失眠障碍患者自我管理的有效工具之一[21]。 目前，国内比较成熟的网络化平台有中国首个30 d心理自助平台CCBT和中国睡眠研究会开展的在线失眠认知行为治疗的抑郁症预防全国病例注册研究（E-aid Sleep-focused TrEatment of Insomnia for Prevention of Major Depression, STEP-MD）所使用的网络化CBT-I系统。CCBT是由中国CBT专业组织的专家团队在参考英国、澳大利亚、美国的CCBT的基础上，结合我国需求者的特点自主研发而成，包含4个方面：抑郁、焦虑、失眠、强迫。每个项目均模拟真实CBT治疗过程、通过量表动态监测心理状况、根据使用者的具体情况个性化设计训练内容、强调心理教育和家庭作业促进自助训练。STEP-MD包括针对慢性失眠障碍患者的4周网络化CBT-I系统（ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03309527）和针对短期失眠障碍患者的1周短程网络化CBT-I系统（ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03302455），分别探索了4周标准网络化CBT-I是否可以降低失眠障碍患者的抑郁症发生率，以及相应地减少自杀观念，并且改善失眠障碍患者的睡眠状况和生活质量，以及1周短期CBT-I是否可以减少短期失眠障碍向慢性失眠障碍的转化。除了进行临床注册，1周短期网络化CBT-I的研究方案已发表[22]，初步的数据分析支持了预想的研究目标，结果尚待发表。此外，一项中国的开放性随机对照研究结果显示，接受标准网络化CBT-I（4周）治疗的患者睡眠效率、睡眠潜伏期、觉醒次数及ISI评分均得到明显的改善，与对照组相比，无论是以睡眠效率>85%或ISI < 8分为失眠痊愈指标，干预组痊愈率均明显高于对照组。然而，该研究也发现干预组患者治疗依从性不高，仅57.9%的失眠患者完成了4周网络化CBT-I，以SHUTi、Sleepio为基础的研究也存在类似的问题，提示了网络化CBT-I的进一步改善方向[23]。目前，国内的网络化CBT-I平台仍在起步阶段，未来希望有更多的专业化平台出现，并通过临床研究证实其有效性。 3.3. 自助+治疗师部分参与的网络化CBT-I 与全自助的网络化CBT-I不同的是，这种方式结合了治疗师的干预。在患者完成一定的治疗进度时，治疗师通过电子邮件或网络聊天功能提供反馈，或当患者遇到疑惑或困难时，治疗师及时通过互联网解答。研究表明，治疗师部分参与的自助网络化CBT-I治疗对睡眠质量、总睡眠时间、睡眠效率、焦虑和抑郁症状、生活质量均有明显的改善，且治疗师可以在治疗开始时即提供个性化的治疗方案，具有显著的治疗效果和较高的依从率[24]。一项随机平行组试验结果显示[25]，与等待对照组相比，无电话支持的网络化CBT-I组和有电话支持的网络化CBT-I组患者的睡眠效率明显提高，并且失眠程度和睡眠信念评分更低，而与无电话支持的全自助网络化CBT-I组相比，添加15 min/周电话支持的患者入睡潜伏期和睡眠质量方面有更显著的改善。 除了反馈提供的信息和帮助之外，治疗师参与对于改善治疗效果可能有以下因素：（1）患者对治疗师的承诺可能会增强其依从性；（2）患者在实施治疗过程中遇到困难时有机会获得支持，可能增加其实施下一步计划的信心；（3）当患者在执行过程中获得良性体验时，治疗师能及时给予鼓励，可能会增强患者坚持动力；（4）治疗师可针对个体进行微调，如当患者对睡眠限制治疗不适应时，可建议其尝试睡眠压缩法。 3种网络化CBT-I方式均能明显改善失眠症状，但3者之间的有效性是否存在差异目前研究较少。一项随机对照研究纳入73名慢性失眠患者[26]，参与者通过互联网学或者基于远程医疗CBT-I，两种干预措施都包括相同的心理教育、睡眠卫生、刺激控制治疗、睡眠限制治疗、放松训练、认知疗法以及正念冥想和药物治疗辅助，结果显示两组失眠症状、疲劳指数以及工作和社会功能损害都得到明显改善，但是由于样本量较小，两组之间差异无法得到统计学的证实，但对临床研究结果的分析推测患者更倾向远程医疗而非基于互联网的治疗。因此，未来仍需更多的大样本研究探索3者之间的联系与差异。 4. 网络化CBT-I在失眠障碍共病中的疗效 实际临床环境中，很多失眠患者存在共病情况，他们可能在没有临床医生预先筛查的情况下开始自助程序，而网络化CBT-I是否能让失眠障碍与其他疾病共病的患者同样获益，目前已有部分研究者对此问题进行了探索。 4.1. 网络化CBT-I在失眠障碍共病精神疾病中的疗效 有研究招募了303例患合并精神疾病的受试者，比较了网络化CBT-I治疗和网络化睡眠教育之间的疗效差异，与基线相比，网络化CBT-I患者的失眠严重指数评分明显降低，入睡潜伏期、入睡后的觉醒时间明显减少，而仅进行睡眠教育的对照组改善较小[15]。 在改善失眠症状的同时，网络化CBT-I能否进一步改善精神症状以及两者之间是否存在联系？针对这一疑问，有研究通过单盲随机对照研究进行了探索[27]，他们在英国26所大学收集了3755例受试者，通过网络化CBT-I干预10周后，学生的失眠情况得到改善，且表现出持续小幅度的偏执和幻觉减少，此外，研究还发现在特定的年轻人群中，失眠在精神疾病中存在一定的因果关系。本研究增加了我们对精神病发生原因的理解，提示在年轻人中进行睡眠干预非常重要。通常疾病初期的年轻人可能不太愿意因为精神病寻求帮助，因此网络化CBT-I可以发挥其优势，在提供初步帮助的同时，减少患者病耻感。 4.2. 网络化CBT-I在失眠障碍伴躯体疾病中的疗效 尽管失眠常合并躯体疾病，但网络化CBT-I对这部分患者的疗效研究仍较少。一项随机对照研究纳入了255例存在失眠症状的乳腺癌患者[28]，结果提示，与基线相比，网络化CBT-I组的失眠严重程度指数、睡眠质量、入睡潜伏期、入睡后觉醒次数及时间、早醒、总睡眠时间、睡眠效率均得到明显改善，并且在减轻疲劳方面获得益处，因此可考虑将这种低成本治疗可纳入癌症康复计划。 有研究对网络化CBT-I治疗帕金森病人的失眠情况进行了探索[29]，研究招募了28名帕金森共病失眠的受试者，失眠严重程度指数评分>11分。与基线相比，网络化CBT-I组患者治疗后的失眠严重程度指数评分明显降低，但与仅进行睡眠卫生教育的对照组差异不明显，研究提出可能与干预组高脱落率有关，其具体原因仍需要更大样本研究进一步探查。 一项随机临床研究中纳入了106位围绝经期或绝经期且存在失眠症状（ISI≥12）的女性[30]，通过电话方式在8周内进行6次CBT-I（干预组）或绝经期教育（对照组）。参与者每周提交1次电子睡眠日记，并收到针对特定小组的书面教育材料，CBT-I课程包括睡眠限制、刺激控制、睡眠卫生教育、认知重建和行为家庭作业；对照组提则提供有关绝经期和妇女健康教育。与对照组相比，干预组患者的失眠严重程度指数和匹兹堡睡眠质量指数明显降低，睡眠潜伏期、觉醒时间、睡眠效率也明显改善，且维持到24周。同时，干预组患者绝经期潮热相关干扰方面也得到明显改善。 不同的疾病特征可能对网络化CBT-I的反应不同，未来可进一步扩大失眠与其他躯体疾病共病的研究，其中对于失眠和躯体疾病的治疗效果相关因素也需更深层次的探索。 5. 网络化CBT-I的优势及不足之处 网络化CBT-I的优势如下：（1）相较于传统的面对面CBT-I，网络化认知行为治疗可以覆盖更多的人数，符合国内失眠人口基数大的需求，同时可为需要加强护理的患者保留更多的医疗资源；（2）目前国内睡眠医学尚处于起步阶段，具有合格资质的睡眠医师和技师仍较少，且不同的治疗师之间存在操作不统一规范的情况，无治疗师参与或仅需治疗师部分参与的标准网络化CBT-I的推行非常必要；（3）网络化CBT-I让地处偏僻或者经济情况较差的失眠障碍患者仍能及时接受规范的治疗，减少因失眠导致的社会功能受损；（4）网络化CBT-I可以减少患者在交通上的时间和经济花费，无需患者请假往返医院接受治疗，对日常工作和生活影响较小；（5）由于特殊的文化背景以及对心理健康缺乏了解，患者常常因精神疾病的病耻感拒绝寻求治疗，而网络化CBT-I可以让患者足不出户即可接受治疗，减少因往返医院而产生的病耻感；（6）治疗师可以及时跟踪患者的治疗情况，必要时可调整治疗方案；（7）网络化CBT-I通过可视化信息及时反馈给用户，帮助他们了解自身的治疗进度，可能增加其参与动力。 同时，网络化CBT-I也存在不足之处：（1）在治疗过程中，治疗师可能无法全面了解患者失眠诱因以及维持因素的改善情况；（2）对于教育程度低、技术经验少且年龄大的失眠患者，在对治疗的理解及执行方面可能存在一定限制，影响治疗效果；（3）对于行为治疗方面，包括刺激控制、睡眠限制，治疗师无法全面掌控其执行程度及无法执行的原因，导致可能无法及时做出个性化反馈及调整；（4）目前的网络化失眠行为认知治疗对有自伤、自杀风险的患者关注较少，风险评估较简单且无相关重要提醒；（5）网络化CBT-I对于睡眠的评估仅有自陈的方式，缺乏更加客观的评估方式，主观评估结果和客观情况可能存在偏差[31-32]。 6. 结语 失眠障碍发病率高，且随着生活节奏加快，呈现不断升高的趋势，对社会和经济带来了巨大影响。药物治疗起效快，但不良反应多，且长期疗效未知。传统的面对面CBT-I费用高、操作复杂，且合格的睡眠医师及治疗师数量少，以及我国失眠人口多、分布广、经济水平低等，种种因素限制了面对面失眠认知疗法的施行和疗效。随着计算机和互联网的普及，网络化CBT-I可以突破时间和空间限制以更加灵活的方式，较低的成本，统一而规范地为失眠患者提供治疗，无论是治疗师参与或者完全自助方式，都有大量的研究证实其有效性，同时，存在合并症的失眠患者仍可获益。因此，网络化CBT-I的推广具有重要的临床意义。 同时，网络化CBT-I也存在一定局限性，未来的研究方向如下：（1）进一步研究应网络化CBT-I的作用机制，以期望为更多的失眠患者提供具有针对性的治疗方案，增加获益；（2）进一步探究在网络化CBT-I中的治疗师干预程度对依从性以及治疗获益的评价，制定更优的整合方式；（3）进一步探究新的网络化CBT-I，以适应更广泛的人群，包括教育程度低、技术经验少且年龄大的患者；（4）进一步探究针对存在自伤、自杀高风险的患者，如何制定更完善的评估方案和应对措施；（5）进一步探究网络化CBT-I的不良反应和潜在的危害，以及改进的措施；（6）不同的研究中网络化CBT-I组的脱落率相差明显，因此，需要进一步探究脱落率的相关因素；（7）短期失眠障碍具有高患病率和易慢性化的特征[33-34]，因为它往往可以自发缓解，不会造成严重的身心损害，所以并没有像慢性失眠障碍那样引起广泛关注，目前国内仅有一项随机对照研究[22]对网络化CBT-I是否能降低短期失眠障碍慢性化进行了探索，未来期望更多的研究关注短期失眠障碍。 因此，网络化CBT-I可以有效改善成人的失眠症状，以及合并的精神症状和躯体症状，且疗效可长期维持，同时，我们需要重视其不足之处，通过进一步研究以寻找更加高效且易推广的方式。 Biography 杨璐璐，博士研究生，E-mail: luciayangyang@163.com Contributor Information 杨 璐璐 (Lulu YANG), Email:

Reported findings suggest that both acute exercise intervention and long-term regular exercise intervention can improve the disrupted sleep structure and normalize the duration and proportion of the different phases of sleep. Moreover, exercise intervention has a positive effect on the endocrine functions, the metabolic functions, the immune response, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiac functions during sleep. It is a non-medicative therapeutic strategy for improving sleep disorders. The specific type of exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or meditative movement) adopted is one of the moderating variables of exercise intervention programs. Different types of exercise improve sleep disorders by way of different mechanisms. Exercise volume and intensity are another moderating variable of exercise intervention programs. The optimal amount and intensity of exercise for different individuals to improve sleep disorders may vary. Exercise interventions implemented at the different times throughout a day can also have varying degrees of impact on sleep disorders and there is no consensus on the optimal exercise time for improving sleep quality at present. Herein, we summarized the mechanisms by which exercise intervention improves sleep disorders from four perspectives, including epigenetics, hyperarousal, human circadian rhythm, and body temperature regulation. In addition, we discussed the current gaps and prospects of research in this field, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the development of exercise prescriptions for sleep disorders. Keywords: Exercise intervention, Sleep disorders, Mechanism, Review 睡眠障碍是对睡眠时间或睡眠质量不满意且影响日间功能的主观体验，进而导致相关生理机能失调，甚至病理改变[1]。睡眠指数是从睡眠质量、睡眠环境，以及睡眠信念和行为3个维度对居民的睡眠状况进行综合评估。睡眠指数低于60分（百分制）代表存在睡眠问题。《中国睡眠研究报告2023》数据显示，中国居民睡眠指数仅为67.77分[2]。显然，解决我国居民睡眠障碍的问题刻不容缓。 运动干预是根据疾病特点进行的全身或局部运动，进而缓解症状或改善机体功能的一种非药物治疗手段。与药物治疗相比，运动干预具有更好的推广性、普适性和可接受性，且无药物依赖等副作用。目前，运动干预已成为临床上用于改善普通人群以及代谢系统疾病、心脑血管系统疾病等患者群体睡眠障碍的一种重要手段。 近年来，研究人员在运动干预睡眠障碍方面进行了大量的研究，如运用不同运动形式对不同年龄、疾病的睡眠障碍人群实施干预[3-5]。根据现代运动处方理论[6]，在制定“精准化”运动处方前应首先对运动干预的内容、持续时长、运动强度、运动量以及干预疾病的机制等进行研究。但目前这些方面还未得到系统的探讨，这使得干预睡眠障碍的运动方案缺少理论指导。同时，不同方案的改善效果存在明显差异。因此，本文从运动干预对睡眠生理的影响、运动干预影响睡眠障碍的调节变量、作用机制等方面进行讨论，为制定睡眠障碍“精准化”运动处方提供理论依据。 1. 运动干预对睡眠生理的影响 1.1. 运动干预对睡眠结构的影响 1.1.1. 急性运动干预对睡眠结构的影响 运动可改善睡眠障碍患者紊乱的睡眠结构，使各期睡眠时长和比例趋于正常。急性运动对睡眠结构的影响表现为小幅度增加慢波睡眠（slow-wave sleep, SWS）时长和快速眼动睡眠（rapid eye movement, REM）潜伏期，减少REM。当运动发生在睡前4~8 h，能缩短睡眠潜伏期（sleep onset latency, SOL）和入睡后觉醒时长（wakefulness after sleep onset, WASO）[7]。王宝森等[8]利用有氧运动、抗阻运动、有氧联合抗阻运动对老年人进行急性运动干预后发现，老年人的SOL减少、睡眠效率（sleep efficiency, SE）提高，且不同运动形式对老年人睡眠障碍的改善存在差异。 1.1.2. 长期规律性运动干预对睡眠结构的影响 长期规律性运动对睡眠结构的影响主要表现为增加SWS、总睡眠时长（total sleep time, TST），减少REM、SOL、WASO等。KALAK等[9]对51名青少年进行干预后发现，与对照组相比，运动组的睡眠结构出现明显变化，表现为TST和SE提高，而SOL减少，REM睡眠潜伏期延长。规律性运动还能提高主观睡眠质量，改善情绪和注意力。动物研究同样显示，大鼠在夜间进行8周规律性运动后，显著降低了碎片化睡眠（约35%）、增加了非快动眼睡眠（non-rapid eye movement, NREM）期间δ波[10]。 1.2. 运动干预对睡眠期间生理功能的影响 1.2.1. 运动干预对睡眠期间内分泌功能的影响 运动过程中机体代谢和各种激素水平的变化是对相应中枢神经递质和免疫功能的调节应答。对运动起应答反应的激素轴有性腺轴、生长激素轴、下丘脑-垂体-肾上腺轴（hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, HPA），以及交感神经系统轴（sympathetic nervous system, SNS）等。睡眠期间，HPA轴和SNS轴的活性随血浆皮质醇、肾上腺素和去甲肾上腺素的降低而下降[11]。 研究发现，长时间中等强度运动可影响夜间睡眠中血清生长激素（growth hormone, GH）浓度和皮质醇（cortisol, COR）水平。TUCKOW等[12]发现，运动引起第1阶段睡眠（23:00–3:00）血清GH浓度降低，COR分泌增加；第2阶段睡眠（3:00–7:00）血清GH浓度增加，COR分泌减少。此外，运动还会影响血清睾酮（testosterone, T）、褪黑素（melatonine, MT）的分泌，在短时间、高强度运动前后血清睾酮的监测中发现，血清睾酮的浓度出现先升后降的变化特征[13]。 1.2.2. 运动干预对睡眠期间代谢功能的影响 机体的物质能量代谢受多种激素的共同调节。运动对血清GH和COR分泌的作用可降低胰岛素抵抗，增强骨骼肌对葡萄糖和氨基酸的吸收，提高TST和SE[14]。 FENTON等[15]发现，傍晚进行抗阻运动后在临睡前补充蛋白质可提高睡眠期间蛋白质合成速率，肌肉形态和功能得到恢复，提示运动有助于改善睡眠期间的代谢功能，并通过增加TST来增加瘦素水平和降低生长素释放肽调节食欲和饥饿感。睡眠缺乏也会导致机体瘦素水平的下降，生长素释放肽升高，进而增加食欲和饥饿感[16]。 1.2.3. 运动干预对睡眠期间免疫应答的影响 睡眠与免疫系统之间存在双向联系，一方面细胞因子通过血液、神经等途径影响睡眠；另一方面睡眠也可诱导神经活性，反作用于细胞因子。参与睡眠觉醒调控的主要细胞因子包括白细胞介素（interleukin, IL）-1、IL-2、IL-6、表皮生长因子（epidermal growth factor, EGF），肿瘤坏死因子（tumor necrosis factor, TNF）等，其主要生理功能与增加SWS、改变睡眠结构有关[17]。 长期规律性运动能调节慢性失眠后促炎性细胞因子和抗炎性细胞因子之间的平衡，从而建立稳定的睡眠-觉醒周期[18]。研究表明[19]，力竭性运动通常会降低外周血1型T细胞数量和形成促炎性细胞因子、γ干扰素（interferon-γ, IFN-γ）的能力，进而增加IL-1、IL-6和TNF的浓度，而中等强度运动可以产生适宜浓度的细胞因子。 1.2.4. 运动干预对睡眠期间自主神经系统和心脏功能的影响 普通人群在睡眠期间的SNS活性减弱、副交感神经系统（parasympathetic nervous system, PNS）活性增强，在觉醒和运动期间的SNS活性增强、PNS活性减弱，这种特征使心率和血压呈现出昼夜节律性变化。心率变异性（heart rate variability, HRV）被广泛用于监测不同睡眠阶段、失眠期间自主神经系统的活动[20]。 急性运动后睡眠初始阶段心率的升高可能是迷走神经活性减弱、SNS活性增强的结果。长期规律性运动可对人体睡眠期间PNS和SNS的活性产生良性影响。对久坐少动人群进行2个月中等强度的运动干预后发现，受试者在睡眠期间的PNS活性增强，SNS活性降低[7]。 2. 运动干预影响睡眠障碍的调节变量 2.1. 运动干预的类型 2.1.1. 有氧运动 有氧运动是改善睡眠障碍常见的运动之一，其主要特征是运动强度不大，持续时间较长。KING等[21]采用有氧运动对睡眠障碍患者实施干预，利用匹兹堡睡眠量表（Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI）、睡眠日记以及多导睡眠监测（polysomnography, PSG）证实了有氧运动具有改善睡眠障碍的效果。研究发现[22]，通过PSQI得分反应有氧运动改善睡眠障碍的均数差为-1.85。有氧运动可影响脑源性神经营养因子（brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF）启动子IV区甲基化及BDNF的mRNA表达水平，增强神经发育和大脑可塑性，进而改善认知功能和睡眠质量[23]。 2.1.2. 抗阻运动 抗阻运动是通过整体或局部的力量练习，实现肌纤维数量和肌肉体积增加的一种运动形式。抗阻运动不但可以有效改善睡眠质量，还能改善与睡眠障碍相关的共病（如焦虑、抑郁等）。WHITWORTH等[24]对创伤后应激障碍导致睡眠障碍的患者进行为期3周的高强度抗阻训练，发现训练组SE、SOL、焦虑水平等均得到明显改善。抗阻运动改善睡眠障碍的机制可能与有氧运动存在差异。首先，抗阻运动是通过多次重复刺激骨骼肌系统，实现肌纤维数量增加和体积增大，抗阻运动诱发骨骼肌等外周组织细胞的变化会反馈作用于物质能量的合成或分解代谢，反向调控骨骼肌时钟基因的表达[25]。其次，抗阻运动还能提高肌肉组织摄取和氧化游离脂肪酸的能力，提高肌肉脂解酶的活性，增强骨骼肌的分泌功能[26]。 2.1.3. 身心运动 身心运动是一种动作节奏缓慢柔和，注重呼吸、意念与动作相结合的运动形式。IRWIN等[27]考察了6个月太极拳练习对睡眠障碍老年人睡眠质量改善效果，结果发现，太极拳练习组的主观睡眠质量、SE、TST、C-反应蛋白（C-reactive protein, CRP）等出现明显改善。八段锦、瑜伽等运动形式对改善睡眠质量同样具有良好的效果[28]。身心运动改善睡眠障碍的机制与有氧运动和抗阻运动同样存在差异。由于身心运动强调意念，呼吸和躯体运动的配合，通过增强体内PNS的活性、释放情绪，从而改善睡眠障碍[29]。八段锦练习者在柔和缓慢，连贯圆活的动作中将呼吸调整为细、匀、深、长的状态，有助于调节自主神经系统的功能，从而提高睡眠质量[30]。 2.2. 运动量 运动量是对人体运动刺激量度的大小。《美国人身体活动指南第2版（2018）》（简称《活动指南》）推荐美国成年人体力活动的运动量为每周150～300 min中强度有氧体力活动或每周75～150 min高强度有氧体力活动[31]。《活动指南》推荐范围内的运动量越大，睡眠障碍的改善效果越明显。AN等[32]研究发现受试者运动量为25～30 min时，睡眠质量未见明显改善；当运动量达到50~60 min时，SWS、REM、TST等有一定程度改善；而当运动量高于50～60 min时，睡眠质量得到明显改善。 目前，大多数研究的运动量并没有给定准确的剂量，这可能与运动方案和个体差异等因素有关，但理论上应该存在个体最佳运动量[33]。因此，在运动干预前，首先应确定受试者的最佳运动量，并根据受试者运动能力的改善情况进行动态调整。 2.3. 运动强度 运动强度是决定运动负荷的另一要素，是反映负荷对机体刺激的程度。过低的运动强度对人体心血管系统、SNS等的刺激较小，过高的运动强度则会导致人体促炎性细胞因子与抗炎性细胞因子的失衡，引起潜在的运动风险。KLINE等[34]根据每周每千克体质量消耗的热量（kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per week, KKW）将睡眠障碍患者分为4 KKW组、8 KKW组、12 KKW组实施6个月干预，3组睡眠量表得分变化分别为−3.93、−4.06、−6.22，得分负值变化幅度越大，表示改善效果越好。结果提示，运动强度和睡眠障碍改善效果之间存在剂量关系，每个人可能都有适合改善睡眠障碍的最佳运动强度。然而，目前评估不同运动类型的运动强度还缺乏统一的标准。 2.4. 运动时间段 目前，研究人员对于一天中何时运动更有利于改善睡眠质量尚未形成共识。但研究人员提出了3种观点[35]：①晚上运动可能会产生昼夜节律相位延迟效应；②越接近入睡时的运动可能会引起机体的过度兴奋；③在夜间光线不足的情况下运动，会削弱光照对睡眠障碍的改善效果。 针对以上观点，研究人员进行了大量研究。研究发现[36]，夜间运动可提高身体压力水平和体温，增加WASO和降低SE。BENLOUCIF等[37]研究了上午运动和晚上运动对睡眠障碍老年人睡眠质量的改善情况，结果发现，受试者的主观睡眠质量均有改善，但组间睡眠结构的变化无明显差异。FRIMPONG等[38]发现，与无运动对照组相比，在睡前0.5～4 h完成的高强度运动可减少REM（−2.34%）。由于运动除具有提高睡眠质量外，还能改善人体的身体成分、提高心肺机能、免疫系统机能等[39]。因此，在临睡前1 h结束中强度运动更有助于改善睡眠障碍[40]。 3. 运动干预影响睡眠障碍的作用机制 3.1. 人体表观遗传机制 表观遗传学是诊断和治疗睡眠障碍的新兴学科领域。运动改善睡眠障碍的表观遗传机制可能与骨骼肌等外周组织细胞的合成与分解代谢改变、睡眠调节相关时钟基因的表达以及大脑神经可塑性的改变等相关[41]。 运动可导致骨骼肌细胞的线粒体能量合成增加、肌纤维类型发生转变、物质能量代谢增强等，这些结构和功能的改变以相关基因表达为基础。物质与能量代谢的动态平衡是由生物钟驱动的组织特异性节律调节的，急性失眠或慢性睡眠剥夺均会导致生物钟基因的组织特异性转录和DNA甲基化水平发生改变[42]。与稳定的基因序列表达不同的是，表观遗传变化是可逆的。运动诱发骨骼肌和脂肪等外周组织的变化会反馈作用于机体的能量合成或分解代谢，并进一步调控人体时钟基因的表达，改善睡眠障碍[43]。目前已证实许多与睡眠调控相关的基因，如昼夜节律基因、突触传递基因、免疫或应激反应基因，以及信号代谢/细胞生长基因等[44]。 3.2. 人体过度觉醒机制 过度觉醒是睡眠系统和觉醒系统同时活跃的状态，多数被诊断为失眠患者的大脑皮层、躯体以及认知3个层面均处于活跃的状态，这可能会导致SWS和REM减少，SOL、WASO增加等睡眠结构紊乱[45]。功能性神经影像显示[46]，过度觉醒患者在睡眠和清醒状态下大脑的网状系统、下丘脑、杏仁核等区域的活性增高，COR、去甲肾上腺素水平升高，MT水平降低。 研究表明[47]，过度觉醒已成为睡眠障碍发生的原因。目前，针对睡眠障碍的疗法包括药物疗法和非药物疗法，其共同特征之一是降低患者的过度觉醒状态。运动疗法作为一种非药物治疗手段，主要通过提高患者PNS的活性、降低SNS的活性，从而改善睡眠障碍[48]。 3.3. 人体昼夜节律机制 人体昼夜节律系统主要位于下丘脑前区视交叉上核（suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN）及其邻近结构。昼夜节律系统紊乱和振幅变化是导致睡眠时相提前、延迟以及不规则睡眠-觉醒周期的主要原因[49]。此外，SCN自身节律也受到外界环境因素和机体内源性因素的共同调控。其中，光信号是外界环境因素中重要的授时因子；而MT则是机体内源性因素中重要的授时因子。当外界明-暗环境变化保持恒定时，昼夜节律主要受MT水平的影响。 运动是调节昼夜节律的因素之一，其途径是通过调节MT分泌、调节睡眠-觉醒周期等影响昼夜节律[50]。研究发现[51]，在恒定黑暗条件下持续8周耐力运动可提高Clock突变小鼠骨骼肌线粒体水平和运动耐受性，小鼠的昼夜节律发生相移，相移效应与运动开始的时间、运动强度等因素有关。此外，运动还能增加人体内源性时钟与外部环境时钟之间的匹配度，其原因既可能与运动过程中骨骼肌作为分泌器官调节人体的昼夜节律有关，也可能与运动过程中机体产生的细胞因子对分子钟蛋白相位和周期的调节有关[52]。 3.4. 人体体温调节机制 REID等[53]发现，通过调控受试者睡眠期间的体温可以调节SWS的比例。不同的体温节律异常会导致不同类型的睡眠障碍，如体温节律相位延迟会引发入睡困难型睡眠障碍，体温节律相位提前会引发早醒型睡眠障碍等[54]。运动是引起人体温改变的一种重要外部条件。当运动引起体温升高后，体温调节主要是通过与外周血管舒张相关的散热机制来完成。MURPHY等[55]通过连续记录受试者脑电波和核心体温的变化，对体温最大下降率出现的时间与入睡时间、各期睡眠占比等之间关系进行研究，发现核心体温的快速下降缩短了SOL，并有利于进入SWS阶段。如果临睡前暴露于高温环境，不仅会导致TST和SWS减少，还会出现REM同步减少的现象。 4. 总结与展望 运动干预具有调整睡眠结构，改善睡眠期间的内分泌、免疫应答和平衡自主神经系统等作用，其机制与人体表观遗传、过度觉醒、昼夜节律，以及体温调节等相关。但目前有关运动干预方案的理论研究较少，特别是运动干预改善睡眠障碍机制的相关研究较少，对运动干预调节睡眠生理的研究不深入，以及缺乏评估不同运动类型的运动强度的统一指标。因此，强化机制研究并加强临床验证、创新运动干预方案的内容和形式、深入探究运动干预对睡眠生理的影响、建立不同运动类型的运动强度的统一指标是未来该领域深入研究的方向。

According to disease classification systems, sleep disorders can be categorized into more than 90 types, including sleep apnea, insomnia, and hypersomnia. It may cause a variety of adverse consequences, such as depression, anxiety and other emotional disorders, as well as physical diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and stroke. In addition, the relevant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment not only harm physical health, but also are associated with workplace accidents and safety problems, constituting public safety hazards. Sleep disorders have become a major social and scientific problem that impacts on the national economy and the livelihood of the people. Research on sleep disorders should be given more attention by researchers and policy makers. Herein, we mainly discussed the latest findings and difficulties concerning research on the prevention and intervention of sleep disorders and proposed strategies and suggestions accordingly. Keywords: Sleep disorders, Sleep research, Research on mental disorders, Prevention and control 睡眠是人类最基础的生理需求，睡眠不仅是维持机体正常生长发育的重要途径，还对记忆的稳定和整合起着至关重要的作用[1]。近年来，随着经济社会发展，人们受到生活工作压力增大以及生活方式变化等多重因素的影响，睡眠障碍问题日益凸显。睡眠障碍可影响身体、心理、社交和情绪功能，且在成人和儿童等各年龄阶段中都很常见。睡眠障碍种类很多，2017年，美国睡眠医学学会（The American Academy of Sleep Medicine）发布的《睡眠障碍国际分类第3版》（International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition, ICSD-3）将睡眠障碍主要分为七大类，包括失眠（insomnia）、睡眠相关呼吸障碍（sleep-related breathing disorders）、中枢性嗜睡症（central disorders of hypersomnolence）、昼夜节律睡眠-觉醒障碍（circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders）、睡眠异态（parasomnias）、睡眠相关运动障碍（sleep-related movement disorders）和其他睡眠障碍[2]。目前，睡眠障碍相关重大疾病研究已逐渐成为全球各国科技创新的重要布局方向之一，但该领域相关研究尚处于起步阶段，存在诸多瓶颈。我国睡眠医学起步较晚，且随着人口老龄化加剧，所面临的睡眠障碍相关重大疾病的防控挑战也与国际上有所不同。本文基于文献检索分析和专家咨询等方法，梳理了国内外睡眠障碍相关重大疾病的防控现状和挑战，并就下一步科技工作提出几点对策与建议，以期为未来睡眠医学领域的政策制定及研究、管理工作提供参考。 1. 全球睡眠障碍及相关重大疾病的防控面临瓶颈 2013年5月，美国发布《精神障碍诊断与统计手册（第五版）》（Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, DSM-5），将第四版中“原发性失眠症（primary insomnia）”的诊断改为失眠障碍（insomnia disorder）[3-4]，诊断标准包括入睡困难或维持睡眠困难或早醒且不能再入睡而影响日间社会功能，频率为每周至少出现3晚、持续3个月以上等[5]。然而，DSM-5以及ICSD-3对于失眠障碍诊断标准的调整或更新主要是针对临床或科研实践进行完善而不是发现了新的研究证据[6]。除此之外，睡眠呼吸障碍也是睡眠障碍中十分常见的一种，包括阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（obstructive sleep apnea, OSA）、中枢型睡眠呼吸暂停以及睡眠相关的低通气和低氧血症[7]。目前，睡眠障碍相关重大疾病研究成为全球各国脑科学领域布局的重要方向之一，包括近年来相继启动的美国的“大脑（BRAIN）”计划、欧盟的“神经退行性疾病联合研究（Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research, JPND）”计划、日本的“脑/思维（Brain/MINDS）”计划以及韩国脑计划（Korea Brain Initiative）等均涉及睡眠障碍发病机制及防治策略相关研究。总体来讲，全球睡眠障碍的相关探索研究尚处于起步阶段，主要存在以下两方面亟待解决的重要问题： 一是诊断上缺乏客观生物学标准。临床检查手段可反映的患者生物学标志信息十分有限，大多依赖问卷调查，缺乏预测模型以及评估患者预后的客观方法。关于睡眠障碍的神经机理研究多采用脑电图及多导睡眠图等作为主要技术手段，只能反映大脑皮层大尺度范围内的神经元集体电活动信息，难以全面揭示复杂神经环路和脑网络特征。通过功能磁共振成像等技术虽可为睡眠障碍的神经机理研究提供新视角，但单一研究模式所获信息仍有局限，无法全面反映脑网络和神经环路的信息流动。目前，各国都在推进该领域科研攻关，旨在通过整合多导睡眠图、多模态成像技术等新型及传统脑功能研究手段，进行睡眠障碍不同维度脑网络的精准构建和深入分析，结合人群队列随访研究，深入理解睡眠障碍及相关疾病脑功能的生理学变化机制，促进睡眠障碍干预技术创新，为睡眠障碍诊疗水平提升保驾护航。 二是临床干预手段有限。现有干预手段难以达到临床治愈，均以对症为主，主要包括药物及非药物治疗。药物治疗存在多种不良反应，不适宜作为长期治疗手段。美国睡眠医学学会建议进行心理和行为干预，并辅以短期药物治疗[8-9]，心理和行为介入包括失眠认知行为疗法（CBT-I）、单/多成分干预行为疗法和认知重建以及睡眠卫生教育等手段[10]。近年来，随着人工智能技术及大数据的发展，国内外开发了许多远程CBT-I 治疗方式，然而这类非药物治疗存在操作复杂、经济成本高等缺点，限制了其在中低收入国家的推广应用。 上述困境的主要原因是大脑在睡眠障碍相关疾病中的功能变化及神经、遗传机制尚不明确，睡眠障碍的特异性标志物和风险因素也尚未阐明。这些关键性问题已成为寻找睡眠障碍个体化诊断体系的最大障碍，也是对其进行高效干预及疗效评价的瓶颈所在。 2. 我国睡眠障碍防控研究现状及面临的挑战 随着社会现代化和老龄化发展，睡眠障碍发病率迅速升高，以睡眠-觉醒障碍为例，全球发病率为27%，而我国高达38.2%[11-12]。根据我国睡眠研究会2021年3月发布的《2021年运动与睡眠白皮书》显示，我国有3亿多人面临睡眠障碍及相关问题[13]。 我国的睡眠医学研究起步较晚，开始于20世纪50年代，直到1994年，中国睡眠研究会正式成立后才逐渐发展进步[14]。此后，我国科研人员发表与睡眠相关文章的数量逐年增加。基于ClinicalTrials.gov注册平台的检索结果显示，2005年开始，我国科研人员参与的临床试验数量逐渐上升。截至目前，我国睡眠医学临床试验注册总量位居全球第三位（图1）。2014年以来，科技部、国家卫生健康委员会、中央军委后勤保障部和国家药品监督管理局共同布局建设了3家精神心理疾病领域的国家临床医学研究中心，现已初步形成了多地区协同的创新网络，搭建睡眠障碍相关临床研究的国家级平台，大力促进我国睡眠医学研究发展。2021年底，国内发布了首部《中国睡眠医学中心标准化建设指南》，该指南在借鉴国内外睡眠医学中心建设先进经验的基础上，结合我国睡眠医学中心建设的现状，为我国睡眠医学中心标准化建设与发展提供了依据和参考[15]。 自2009年开始，我国逐渐增加睡眠医学研究经费投入，总资助金额从 1988−2009 年的1000余万元增加为2010−2019年的1.5亿元[16]，“十二五”期间，国家自然科学基金委共批准150余项睡眠相关的课题项目，总金额达7500余万元[17]。“十四五”以来，通过国家重点研发计划“常见多发病防治研究”重点专项和科技部科技创新2030−“脑科学与类脑研究”重大项目等国家科技计划的部署，重点围绕睡眠障碍的发病机制、新型干预手段以及人群队列的建设进行攻关，以期进一步阐明相关作用机制，开发出睡眠障碍的新型干预手段。 尽管如此，我国睡眠障碍的防控工作仍面临以下四方面问题： 一是我国睡眠障碍人群的遗传特点与国外差异较大。睡眠-觉醒障碍、OSA等常见的睡眠障碍均系受到基因与环境交互作用影响的复杂多基因遗传病。近年来，复杂疾病遗传机制研究范式从单个致病基因研究转变为以基因、转录、蛋白、代谢多组学检测及关键分子调控网络分析为基础的系统生物学模式，而我国无论是睡眠障碍患者人群的风险位点研究，还是多组学研究均与国外存在一定差距。同时，因遗传异质性导致我国与其他亚、欧人群存在巨大差异，开展国人睡眠障碍疾病遗传研究，对于国人睡眠障碍相关疾病新基因靶点的发现、病因及发病机制的揭示十分必要，结合神经影像与神经调控技术的开发，将为进一步明确睡眠障碍的发病机制、探索全新治疗模式及精准医疗奠定基础。 二是现有临床干预手段仍存在局限性。针对慢性失眠的药物治疗存在“成瘾”风险，而如CBT-I等非药物治疗需要患者长期配合，在我国专业人员数量相对不足的背景下，难以满足患者的治疗需求[18]。此外，由于缺乏对慢性失眠发生发展机制的深入了解，我国临床上的治疗以对症为主，亟需开发特异性、针对性的新型治疗手段并进行临床验证和推广。近年来，相关科研成果不断涌现，一些新型非药物干预手段在慢性失眠防控中的发展潜力也逐渐体现，例如基于声、光、电和磁等刺激开发的新型技术（基于影像导航的Theta爆发式经颅磁刺激技术、闭环-经颅交流电刺激等）具有针对性强和安全性高等优点[19]，但其有效性尚未得到验证，具体治疗机制仍未阐明。 另一方面，对于OSA这一常见睡眠障碍，持续气道正压通气（continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP）是临床一线治疗方式。然而，我国近三分之二的OSA患者在明确诊断后拒绝接受治疗[20]。这可能与以下几点因素相关：①针对OSA这一疾病的宣教不足；②患者临床症状与OSA严重程度不匹配，超过60%的OSA患者日间疲乏等功能损害症状轻微，从而主观臆测自身病情不够严重，无需进行医疗干预[19]；③患者需自费购买治疗设备，治疗费用相对昂贵。同时，即使在选择接受治疗的人群中，我国OSA患者的治疗依从性差，仅有约30%～50%的OSA患者显示出对治疗依从，显著低于西方国家60%～70%的治疗依从率[21-22]。CPAP临床依从性差这一问题在我国尤其严重[21, 23]。 三是我国诊疗资源分布局限，缺乏智能化分级诊疗体系。我国睡眠障碍患者人数众多，且年龄段分布广泛，从儿童到老年人阶段均可能出现不同临床亚型的睡眠障碍，严重危害心身健康。此外，新型冠状病毒感染或加剧睡眠障碍的发生风险[24]。然而，我国睡眠医疗资源存在分布不均现象，部分三甲医院以及少数的二级医院设有睡眠障碍专科门诊和独立的睡眠监测室及治疗室，诊疗与患者需求的供需不平衡现象突出。我国目前的分级诊疗体系有待完善，由于各医院影像质量控制标准和实现程度不一，导致在医联体内推行影像互通互认存在一定难度[25]，迫切需要实行数据标准统一的智能化分级诊疗平台[26]。 四是睡眠障碍相关问题的公众认识水平有待提高[27]。多数人对于睡眠障碍问题不够重视，或存在睡眠健康知识误区，例如认为失眠不是病，或相关症状可以通过补觉代替[28]，饮酒助眠[29]，鼾声越大睡得越香等[30]。此外，因老年人对功能失调性睡眠障碍的心理机制了解不足，导致老年人安全感降低，加剧诱发失眠[31]。为此，国家卫生健康委员会发布的《健康中国行动（2019−2030年）》明确强调要重视睡眠健康，将改善睡眠纳入主要行动指标，并提出了一系列明确的目标要求[32]，以期提高公众对睡眠障碍重视程度，减轻国人睡眠障碍疾病医疗负担及相关经济损失。 3. 有关对策建议 为进一步促进我国睡眠医学研究发展，全面开展睡眠障碍相关疾病脑网络特征与神经、遗传调控机制的研究；阐明睡眠障碍发生发展机制；探索其遗传易感性及脑影像表征；建立早期诊断的综合预警体系和个体化干预策略等新型手段并进行临床验证和推广，是睡眠障碍及相关重大疾病防治的关键。具体建议包括以下三方面： 3.1. 统筹科研部署，完善睡眠障碍相关研究体系 将目前已布局项目进行整合，促进我国睡眠障碍相关研究优势力量和不同地区之间的相互协作，对标国际上睡眠障碍防控研究的前沿进展和趋势，找准科技突破口，进一步明确我国睡眠障碍防控研究的近期、中期和远期目标及任务。加强调动院所、高校、企业的创新积极性，建立基于不同临床亚型的睡眠障碍多中心大队列，实现疾病靶标发现，并构建适宜中国人群的睡眠障碍风险预测模型和预后评估体系，为临床决策和优化医疗资源配置提供循证依据；完成重大关键技术突破以及重点睡眠产品的开发，为提高失眠障碍诊断的敏感性和特异性提供积极有效的科技支撑。 3.2. 推进跨学科合作，深化睡眠障碍的发病机制研究 应用神经调控技术（重复经颅磁刺激、经颅电刺激等）探索睡眠障碍的个体化干预方式有助于克服传统镇静催眠类药物对患者造成依赖性及成瘾性的弊端，且符合睡眠障碍个体化诊疗探索的国际趋势。因此，将神经调控技术与神经影像、电生理、神经内分泌、分子遗传、蛋白组学、肠道微生物等多学科技术融合，有助于明确睡眠障碍的发生发展机制，推动神经调控技术干预睡眠障碍的理论创新和个体化诊疗技术创新。 3.3. 强化我国精神心理疾病领域国家临床医学研究中心的辐射带动作用 以国家临床医学研究中心为依托，以临床应用为导向，构建完整系统的大型中国睡眠障碍人群队列，持续跟踪随访，采集睡眠障碍患者神经影像、电生理、神经内分泌、分子遗传、蛋白组学、肠道微生物数据，结合动物实验，探索不同种类睡眠障碍的有效预测因素和疾病预测模型，提出睡眠障碍调控新理论，为我国睡眠障碍相关诊疗方案的制定提供基础与临床科学证据。 总之，睡眠障碍的防控研究是关系国民健康和国民经济的重要问题，目前我国在该领域的研究应用正加速发展。科研攻关方面，国家科技计划的支持力度不断提升，未来建议进一步增强该领域科研人才培养，注重与信息技术等多学科的交叉融合，以突破现有技术瓶颈；在临床实践方面，未来建议注重基层心理和行为干预领域的专业人员培养，缓解医患供需不平衡的问题，并进一步注重搭建智能化的分级诊疗平台，充分发挥人工智能等创新技术在医疗服务和健康管理等方面的优势。

              "content": "3月21日是第25个世界睡眠日，今年的主题是“睡眠健康，优先之选”，强调睡眠对于整体健康的核心作用。新华网特别邀请北京大学人民医院睡眠医学科主任、北京大学睡眠研究中心主任韩芳做客新华会客厅，针对国人睡眠健康现状、常见睡眠障碍及科学改善方法进行深入解读。韩芳强调，睡眠健康不仅是个人生活质量的保障，更关乎公共安全与社会发展。 睡眠健康：全生命周期面临挑战 现代社会，睡眠问题正逐渐成为全球性的健康挑战。世界卫生组织（WHO）和多项流行病学研究表明，长期睡眠不足或睡眠质量不佳不仅影响个人健康，还对社会生产力、经济发展乃至公共安全产生深远影响。 韩芳指出，睡眠与营养、运动并列为健康的三大支柱，而目前全球约1/3的人群存在不同程度的睡眠问题，而我国约1/3人群存在睡眠问题，其中需医疗干预者达1.5亿。这一现象与我国快速发展的社会进程密切相关。 韩芳列举了不同年龄段的典型睡眠困扰：青少年因课业压力导致睡眠时长不足，影响身心发育；中年群体受职场压力与不良生活方式影响，易出现失眠、睡眠呼吸暂停；老年人则面临生物节律紊乱等问题。他特别强调：\"睡眠问题已不仅是健康问题，更是公共安全隐患。数据显示，相关患者发生交通事故的风险是常人的7倍。\" 而这其中，都市人群的失眠、睡眠周期紊乱等问题尤为突出，韩芳分析认为，这与生活方式、环境因素及社会压力密切相关。 “过去农业社会，人们日出而作、日落而息，而现代社会工作节奏快，尤其是脑力劳动者，长期熬夜、工作压力大，导致‘睡不困、睡不深’的现象普遍。”韩芳解释说，睡眠质量不仅受压力影响，还与昼夜节律、光污染密切相关。 “晚上玩手机、过度摄入咖啡因、夜间光污染等都会抑制褪黑素的正常分泌，导致生物钟紊乱。”韩芳提到，从卫星云图上看，中国沿海城市、韩国、日本等经济发达地区夜晚依然灯火通明，这种长期的光环境干扰直接影响了人们的入睡时间和睡眠质量。 此外，不合理的饮食与习惯也影响睡眠，例如过量饮酒、咖啡摄入，以及学生群体因课业压力导致的睡眠时间不。韩芳指出，部分家长和学生存在错误认知，认为“睡得少才能学得多”，但实际上，长期睡眠不足反而影响学习效率、记忆力和身心发育。 “睡眠问题已不仅是个体健康问题，它对社会生产力、公共安全、甚至整个生命周期的健康管理都产生了重要影响。”韩教授特别强调，睡眠质量下降不仅影响个人的身体和心理健康，还与交通安全、职业表现以及老龄化健康管理密切相关。 为应对这一挑战，国家已将睡眠健康纳入《健康中国行动（2019-2030）》，并在2025年“改善睡眠服务”列入国家卫健委公布的年度重点民生工程，推动全国范围内区、地级医院普及睡眠门诊，以提升睡眠障碍诊疗水平。 警惕常见睡眠障碍，科学管理睡眠健康 尽管越来越多人意识到睡眠健康的重要性，但许多患者仍然缺乏对睡眠障碍的认识，往往等到症状严重影响生活质量时才寻求帮助。韩芳指出，了解常见的睡眠障碍类型及其成因，是科学改善睡眠的第一步。 常见的睡眠障碍类型包括、失眠症、昼夜节律紊乱、不宁腿综合征、发作性睡病等，而这些睡眠问题通常是多因素共同作用的结果，包括生活方式、心理状态、生理因素和疾病影响等。 韩芳建议，面对睡眠问题，首先要找出根本原因，并针对具体情况采取个性化的干预措施，而不是一味依赖安眠药或其他短期手段。针对不同类型的睡眠障碍，韩芳强调，科学的睡眠管理与规范的医学干预是改善睡眠质量的关键，需要从生活习惯、环境优化到医学干预等多方面入手，综合管理睡眠问题。 1. 养成健康的作息习惯：韩芳指出，规律的作息是保障睡眠质量的基本前提。 （1）保持固定的睡眠时间：每天尽量在同一时间上床和起床，即使周末也应避免过度补觉，以维持稳定的生物钟节律。 （2）减少临睡前的电子设备使用：手机、电脑、电视等电子产品所发出的蓝光会抑制褪黑素分泌，延迟入睡时间。建议睡前1小时尽量避免使用电子屏幕。 （3）避免咖啡因和酒精的干扰：下午和晚上尽量减少咖啡、浓茶等刺激性饮品的摄入，避免影响入睡。虽然酒精可能让人短时间内产生困倦感，但实际上会破坏睡眠结构，使人更容易早醒。 2. 营造良好的睡眠环境：韩芳教调，优化睡眠环境对于提升睡眠质量至关重要。 （1）控制卧室光线和噪音：黑暗的环境有助于褪黑素分泌，因此建议使用遮光窗帘，降低房间亮度。此外，避免夜间噪音干扰，如必要时可使用耳塞或白噪音设备。 （2）调整适宜的睡眠温度：一般来说，较低的环境温度有助于入睡，建议室温保持在18-22℃之间，并根据个人舒适度选择合适的床垫和枕头。 （3）将卧室专用于睡眠：尽量避免在床上进行与睡眠无关的活动，如工作、看剧等，以免削弱床与睡眠的关联性。 3. 针对睡眠障碍采取个性化干预 对于已经出现长期睡眠问题的人群，韩芳建议，不要一味依赖安眠药，而应寻求科学的方法进行干预。 （1）认知行为治疗：对于长期失眠患者，认知行为治疗被认为是最有效的非药物疗法之一。这种疗法通过调整患者的睡眠认知和行为习惯，帮助其建立健康的睡眠模式。 （2）医学干预：对于睡眠呼吸暂停综合征患者，可采用持续气道正压通气治疗，以防止夜间呼吸暂停。此外，对于症状较轻的患者，也可以通过减重、调整睡姿等方式改善症状。 （3）合理使用睡眠辅助产品：褪黑素作为一种常见的助眠补充剂，在短期调整时差、帮助轻度睡眠障碍患者入睡方面有一定作用，但不应长期依赖。韩芳提醒，使用任何助眠产品前，都应咨询医生的专业建议。 睡眠是人体恢复能量、维持健康的重要环。韩芳指出，通过科学的睡眠管理、良好的作息习惯和适当的医学干预，每个人都可以改善自身的睡眠质量，提高生活质量和健康水平。",

              "content": "什麼是樣本量？ 樣本量是統計學和市場研究中常用的術語。如果您要對大量的受訪者進行調查，您將不可避免地遇到這個詞。樣本量與對大量人羣進行研究的方法有關。 那麼，什麼是抽樣？為什麼樣本大小很重要？ 當調查大量受訪者時，您是對整個羣體感興趣，但在實際操作中，不可能從每個人那裡一一獲取答案或結果。因此，透過隨機抽取個體樣本，以代表整個羣體。 樣本的大小，對於獲得準確、具有統計意義的結果，乃至研究的成功與否都至關重要。 - 如果樣本太小，其中可能包含不成比例的異常值，或異常個體。這將產生偏態數據，讓您無法客觀勾勒出整個羣體。 - 如果樣本太大，研究將變得很複雜、代價昂貴，且執行起來耗時費力。雖然結果可能更準確，但成本與收益未必成正比。 如果您已計算出變量，您可使用樣本量計算器快速算出正確的樣本量。 如果您想從頭開始，為市場研究確定適當的樣本量，請讓我們引導您完成相關步驟。 學習如何確定樣本量 要想選對樣本量，需要考慮影響研究的若干因素，並對涉及的統計資料有基本的瞭解。只要使用樣本量公式，將所有的數值放在一起，您便可自信地開始抽樣，因為調查的統計結果大概率是準確的。 以下步驟適用於為連續數據確定樣本量——即以數字方式計數的數據。 它不適用於分類數據——如綠色、藍色、男性和女性等類別。 階段1：考慮樣本大小變量 計算樣本量之前，先要確定目標人羣的相關參數，及您需要的準確度： 1.人口數量 您總共需要調查多少人？要弄清這一點，您需要明確哪些人適合參與您的調查。例如，如果您想瞭解養狗的主人，樣本就要包括至少養過一隻狗的羣體。根據研究目標，可包括或排除以往養過狗的人。即使無法計算出確切的數字，也不必擔心。數字不明確，或僅可估算範圍的情況是很常見的。 2.誤差範圍（信賴區間） 錯誤是不可避免的——關鍵在於您允許多少錯誤。誤差範圍，即信賴區間，以平均數表示。您可設置樣本平均數與總體平均數之間允許的誤差。如果您曾在新聞上看過政治民意調查，您就會看到信賴區間及其表達方式，如「68%的選民同意提案Z，誤差範圍為+/-5%。」 。 3.信賴水準 這是一個單獨的步驟，與步驟2中的信賴區間相似。涉及您對實際均值在誤差範圍內的信賴程度。最常見的信賴區間的信賴水準有90%、95%和99%。 4.標準差 此步驟是估算各個受訪者的答復與平均值之間的差異程度。低標準差，意味著所有數值較接近平均值；高標準差，意味著數值分佈更離散，存在極小的和極大的異常數值。由於您尚未開始調查，因此，保守的標準差選擇是0.5，以此確保樣本量足夠大。 階段2：計算樣本量 您已透過步驟1到4獲得答案，現在，您可開始計算所需的樣本量。您可使用上方的在線樣本量計算器，或手算完成此步驟。 1.找到Z分數 接下來，需要將信賴水準轉換為Z分數。以下是最常見的信賴水準對應的Z分數： - 90% – Z分數 = 1.645 - 95% – Z分數 = 1.96 - 99% – Z分數 = 2.576 如果您選擇其他信賴水準，請使用我們的Z分數表，查看相應的分數。 2.使用樣本量公式 將Z分數、標準差和誤差範圍輸入樣本量計算器中，或使用此樣本量公式自行計算： 該公式適用於人口數量未知，或人口數量極其龐大的調查。如果您的調查對象較少，您只需使用上方的樣本量計算器，或點擊此處。 真實操作起來是什麼樣的？ 這是一個已算好的示例，假設信賴水準為95%、標準差為0.5，誤差範圍為+/-5%（信賴區間）。 ((1.96)2 x .5(.5)) / (.05)2 (3.8416 x .25) / .0025 .9604 / .0025 384.16 需要訪問385個人 瞧！樣本量已經確定 樣本量結果故障排除 如果樣本量太大，無法管理，您可透過以下任一方式調整結果： - 降低信賴水準 - 提高誤差範圍 這將增大樣本量出錯的概率，但會大大減少需要的受訪者數量。 繼續閱讀我們的市場研究指南",

              "content": "表格内容 什么是样本大小？ 简单来说，样本大小是指研究或调查中的观察或参与者数量。它是研究设计的关键部分，因为样本大小越大，结果越能反映更大人群的真实行为、偏好或观点。 然而，样本大小不仅仅是“越多越好”，而是要在准确性、成本和时间之间找到平衡。 样本大小重要吗？ 样本大小之所以至关重要，原因很简单：准确性。样本大小过小可能导致不准确或误导性的结论。如果只调查少数人，结果可能无法很好地代表总体，导致样本偏差。 但如果样本大小过大，成本和时间就会不必要地增加。此外，收益递减法则会生效——在某个点之后，增加样本大小并不会显著改善结果的准确性。 合理计算的样本大小能带来： - 精准度：确保调查结果反映人群的真实情感，而非随机异常值。 - 信心：正确的样本大小让你对结果的有效性和可重复性更有信心。 - 效率：找到合适的样本大小可以节省资源，无论是调查客户、进行学术研究还是测试产品偏好。 获取合适的样本大小意味着在准确性和资源利用之间取得双赢。 如何计算样本大小 计算样本大小需要考虑几个不同因素，包括： 让我们看一个例子来生动展示这些概念。 假设你正在进行一项调查，以了解预计将吸引10,000名与会者的活动上的饮品偏好。你希望置信水平为95%，误差范围为5%。为计算所需的样本大小以确定饮品的采购数量，你输入这些值，并估计比例为50%，因为你不确定人群的真实行为。 结果可能显示你需要370个受访者的样本大小才能获得可靠结果。这比试图对每个计划参加的人进行调查更高效——这是在准确预测和可管理努力之间的一个甜蜜点。 通过样本大小确定统计显著性 如果你要进行研究或基于调查的工作，必须确保你的发现具有统计显著性。统计显著性告诉你调查结果不仅仅是偶然的，统计显著性的最小样本大小取决于总体大小、所需置信水平和误差范围。 对于较大的人口（例如，数百万人），即使样本大小只有几百，也可能得到统计显著的结果。但对于较小的人口，你需要更高比例的受访者才能达到相同的置信水平。 确保测试可靠性的A/B测试样本大小计算器 A/B测试广泛应用于营销、产品设计和网站优化，比较两个产品或信息的变化，以查看哪个更好——获取正确的样本大小是确保A/B测试可靠性的重要因素。 假设你正在测试品牌的新青柠绿色徽标的表现。你需要足够的反应来对两种徽标版本（A代表现有徽标，B代表新徽标）得出有意义的结论。样本过小可能无法检测到两者之间的显著差异；样本过大则无谓地消耗时间和资源。 借助A/B测试样本大小计算器，你可以确定需要多少访客才能自信地宣布胜者。 平衡统计样本大小和置信水平 样本大小的计算与置信水平相关。调查中最常见的置信水平是95%，因为它表明结果可能在一个小误差范围内反映总体（通常是±5%）。 提高置信水平（例如到99%）会需要更大的样本大小——但对于结果的额外置信度可能值得额外的资源。这就是在可靠性与效率之间找到平衡的问题。 样本大小如何影响调查结果 样本大小直接影响调查结果的可靠性。归根结底，适当的样本大小不仅仅是一个技术细节——它是进行提供可操作的、可信的洞察研究的关键。 - 较小的样本大小往往会导致较大的误差范围，使得得出可靠结论变得困难。 - 较大的样本大小减少变异性，提高结果的精准度。 拥有合适的样本大小，你可以更自信地认为自己的发现代表了更广泛的人群。 通过计算适当的样本大小，确保你的研究结果在统计上是合理的、可靠的和具有成本效益的。 所以下次当你准备进行调查、投票或A/B测试时，花时间使用LimeSurvey的样本大小计算器，为你的结果提供应有的准确性。你的数据和决策者都会感谢你！ 现在创建你的第一个调查！ 这就像挤一个青柠一样简单。 - 用40多种语言创建调查 - 无限数量的用户 - 800多个现成的调查模板 - 还有更多...",

在第三层次的数据清理中，我们将重点关注记录的数值，并将采取措施确保关于数据中记录的数值的三个事项得到解决。首先，我们将确保数据中的缺失值已经被发现，我们知道为什么会发生这种情况，并且已经采取了适当的措施来解决这些问题。第二，我们将确保我们已经采取了适当的措施，使记录的数值是正确的。第三，我们将确定数据中的极端点已经被发现，并且已经采取了适当的措施来解决这些问题。 第三级数据清理在与数据分析目标和工具的关系上与第二级类似。虽然一级数据清理可以在不关注数据分析目标和工具的情况下孤立地进行，但二级和三级数据清理必须在我们了解分析目标和工具的情况下进行。在上一章的例子1、2、3中，我们体验了如何针对分析工具进行II级数据清理。本章的例子也将与分析情况有很好的联系。 在这一章中，我们将介绍以下主要内容。 - 缺失值 - 异常值 - 误差 1 缺少的值 缺失值，顾名思义，是指我们期望得到但没有得到的数值。最简单地说，缺失值是指我们想用于分析目标的数据集中的空单元。例如，下面的截图显示了一个有缺失值的数据集的例子--第一个和第三个学生的平均成绩（GPA）缺失，第五个学生的身高缺失，第六个学生的性格类型缺失。 在Python中，缺失的值不是用空来表示的--它们是通过NaN来表示的，NaN是Not a Number的缩写。虽然Not a Number的字面意思并没有完全涵盖我们有缺失值的所有可能情况，但在Python中，只要我们有缺失值，就会使用NaN。 下面的截图显示了一个pandas DataFrame，它已经读取并呈现了图11.1中的表格。对比这两张截图后，你会发现图11.1中每一个空的单元格在图11.2中都是NaN。 我们现在知道什么是缺失值，以及它们在我们选择的分析环境--Python中是如何呈现的。不幸的是，缺失值并不总是以一种标准的方式呈现；例如，在pandas DataFrame上有NaN是呈现缺失值的一种标准方式。然而，不了解情况的人可能会用一些内部协议来呈现缺失值，如MV、None、99999和N/A。如果缺失值没有以标准的方式呈现，那么处理它们的第一步就是要纠正这一点。在这种情况下，我们会检测数据集作者的意思是缺失值，然后用np.nan来代替它们。 即使缺失值是以标准方式呈现的，检测它们有时可能就像用眼睛看数据集一样容易。当数据集很大的时候，我们不能依靠眼看数据来检测和理解缺失值。接下来，我们将把注意力转向如何检测缺失值，特别是对于较大的数据集。 1.1 检测缺失值 每个Pandas DataFrame都有两个函数，在检测哪些属性有缺失值以及有多少缺失值方面非常有用。.info() 和.isna() 。 下面的例子显示了如何使用这些函数来检测一个数据集是否有缺失值，以及有多少值被缺失。 1.2 检测缺失值的例子 Airdata.csv 空气质量数据集包括2020年三个地点的每小时记录。该数据集--除了A、B、C三个地点的二氧化氮读数外--还有日期时间、温度、湿度、风速和风向读数。下面的截图显示了将文件读入air_df DataFrame 的代码，并显示了数据集的第一和最后几行。 import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt air_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Data-Preprocessing-in-Python/main/Chapter11/Airdata.csv') air_df.head() 我们可以使用的第一个方法是使用.info() 函数来检测数据的任何一列是否有任何缺失值。下面的截图展示了这个函数在air_df上的应用。 air_df.info() 正如你在前面的截图中看到的，air_df 有8784行（条目）数据，但NO2_Location_A、NO2_Location_B和NO2_Location_C列的非空值较少，这意味着这些属性有缺失值。 第二个方法是使用Pandas Series的.isan() 函数来计算哪些属性有缺失值。Pandas DataFrames和Pandas Series都有.isan()函数，它输出相同的数据结构，所有的单元格都用布尔值填充，表示该单元格是否为NaN。下面的截图使用.isan()函数来计算air_df的每个属性中的NaN条目数。 print('Number of Missing Values: ') for col in air_df.columns: n_MV = sum(air_df[col].isna()) print('{}:{}'.format(col, n_MV)) air_df.isna().sum() 在前面的截图中，我们看到这三个地方的二氧化氮读数都有缺失值。这只是证实了我们在图11.4中使用.info()函数进行的缺失值检测。 现在我们知道了如何检测缺失值，让我们把注意力转移到理解是什么导致了这些值的缺失。在我们处理缺失值的过程中，我们首先需要知道为什么会发生这种情况。在下一个分章中，我们将重点讨论哪些情况会导致缺失值。 1.3 造成缺失值的原因 为什么会出现缺失值，可能有各种各样的原因。正如我们在本章中所看到的那样，了解一个数值缺失的原因是使我们能够有效处理缺失数值的最重要信息。下面列出了可能出现缺失值的最常见原因。 - 人为错误。 - 受访者可能会拒绝回答某个调查问题。 - 接受调查的人不理解这个问题。 - 提供的数值是一个明显的错误，所以被删除。 - 没有足够的时间来回答问题。 - 由于缺乏有效的数据库管理而丢失记录。 - 故意删除和跳过数据收集（可能有欺诈的意图）。 - 参与者在研究过程中退出。 - 第三方篡改或阻挠数据收集。 - 错过的观察。 - 传感器故障。 - 程序错误。 作为数据分析师，在处理数据时，有时你所拥有的只是数据，你没有任何人可以向你提出关于数据的问题。因此，重要的是对数据要有好奇心，想象一下缺失值背后的原因。当你要猜测是什么原因造成缺失值时，把前面的清单记在脑子里并理解这些原因会对你有好处。 不言而喻，如果你能接触到了解数据的人，关于找出缺失值的原因，最好的办法就是询问信息提供者。 不管是什么原因造成的缺失值，从数据分析的角度来看，我们可以将所有的缺失值归为三种类型。了解这些类型对于决定如何处理缺失值将是非常重要的。 1.4 缺失值的类型 一个属性中的一个或一组缺失值可能属于以下三种类型之一：完全随机缺失（MCAR），随机缺失（MAR），以及非随机缺失（MNAR）。这些类型的缺失值之间存在着一种顺序关系。从MCAR到MNAR，缺失值变得更有问题，更难处理。 missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). 当我们没有任何理由相信这些值是由于任何系统性的原因而缺失的时候，就会使用MCAR。当一个缺失值被归类为MCAR时，有缺失值的数据对象可能是任何一个数据对象。例如，如果一个空气质量传感器由于互联网连接的随机波动而无法与其服务器通信以保存记录，那么缺失的值就属于MCAR类型。这是因为互联网连接问题可能发生在任何一个数据对象上，但它只是碰巧发生在它所发生的对象上。 另一方面，当数据中的某些数据对象更有可能出现缺失值时，我们就有MAR。例如，如果高风速有时会导致传感器发生故障，使其无法给出读数，那么在高风中发生的缺失值就被归类为MAR。理解MAR的关键是，导致出现缺失值的系统性原因并不总是导致缺失值，而是增加了数据对象出现缺失值的倾向。 最后，MNAR发生在我们确切知道哪个数据对象会有缺失值的时候。 例如，如果一个倾向于排放过多空气污染物的发电厂为了避免向政府支付罚款而篡改了传感器，那么由于这种情况而没有收集的数据对象将被归类为MNAR。MNAR缺失值是最有问题的，弄清它们发生的原因并阻止它们发生往往是数据分析项目的首要任务。 接下来，我们将学习如何使用数据分析工具来诊断缺失值的类型。在下一节中，我们将看到一个例子，展示了三种类型的缺失值。 1.5 对缺失值的诊断 一个有缺失值的属性实际上有两个变量的信息：它本身和一个隐藏属性。隐藏属性是一个二进制属性，当有缺失值时，其值为1，否则为0。为了弄清缺失值的类型（MCAR、MAR和MNAR），我们需要做的就是调查有缺失值的属性的隐藏二元变量与数据集中的其他属性之间是否存在关系。下面的列表显示了我们期望看到的基于每一种缺失值类型的关系种类。 - MCAR。我们不期望隐藏的二元变量与其他属性有有意义的关系。 - MAR：我们希望隐藏的二元变量与其他属性中至少有一个有意义的关系。 - MNAR。我们希望隐藏的二元变量和至少一个其他属性之间有很强的关系。 下面的小节展示了三种具有不同类型缺失值的情况，我们将使用我们的数据分析工具包来帮助我们诊断它们。 我们将继续使用我们之前看到的air_df数据集。我们看到，NO2_Location_A、NO2_Location_B和NO2_Location_C分别有120、560和176个缺失值。我们将逐一解决每一列下缺失值的诊断问题。 1.5.1 诊断NO2_Location_A的缺失值 为了诊断缺失值的类型，有两种方法供我们使用：视觉和统计方法。这些诊断方法必须针对数据集中的所有属性运行。数据中有四个数字属性。温度、湿度、风向和风速。数据中还有一个DateTime属性，可以解包为四个分类属性：月、日、小时和工作日。我们需要运行分析的方式对于数字属性和分类属性来说是不同的。因此，首先，我们将学习数字属性，然后我们将把注意力转向分类属性。 让我们从 \"温度 \"数字属性开始。另外，我们先从视觉上做诊断，然后再从统计学上做诊断。 基于温度的缺失值诊断 视觉诊断是通过比较两个种群的温度值来完成的：第一，NO2_Location_A 有缺失值的数据对象，第二，NO2_Location_A 无缺失值的数据对象。在第5章 \"数据可视化 \"中，在比较种群下，我们学习了如何使用数据可视化来比较种群。这里，我们将使用这些技术。我们可以使用boxplot或者直方图来做这件事。让我们同时使用这两种方法--首先是boxplot ，然后是histogram 。 下面的截图显示了代码和比较两个种群的boxplot。该代码与我们在第五章 \"数据可视化 \"中学到的非常相似，所以我们只讨论可视化的意义。 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_A.isna() MV_labels = ['With Missing Values','Without Missing Values'] box_sr = pd.Series('',index=BM_MV.unique()) for poss in BM_MV.unique(): BM = BM_MV == poss box_sr[poss] = air_df[BM].Temperature plt.boxplot(box_sr,vert=False) plt.yticks([1,2],MV_labels) plt.show() 观察前面的截图中的图表，我们可以看到温度的值在两个人群中没有意义的变化。这表明温度的变化不可能导致或影响NO2_Location_A下缺失值的发生。 我们也可以用柱状图来做这个分析。这在第五章 \"数据可视化 \"中的 \"种群比较 \"中也有展示。下面的截图显示了创建直方图和比较两个种群的代码。 BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_A.isna() temp_range = (air_df.Temperature.min(),air_df.Temperature.max()) MV_labels = ['With Missing Values','Without Missing Values'] plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) plt.style.use('ggplot') for i,poss in enumerate(BM_MV.unique()): plt.subplot(1,2,i+1) BM = BM_MV == poss air_df[BM].Temperature.hist() plt.xlim = temp_range plt.title(MV_labels[i]) plt.show() 前面的截图证实了我们在使用boxplots时得出的相同结论。由于我们没有看到两个群体之间的明显差异，我们得出结论，\"温度 \"的值不可能影响或导致缺失值的发生。 最后，我们还想用一种统计方法来确认：双样本t检验。 双样本t检验评估一个数字属性的值在两组中是否有显著的不同。这里的两组是在NO2_Location_A下有缺失值的数据对象和在NO2_Location_A下没有缺失值的数据对象。 简而言之，双样本t检验假设两组之间的属性值没有显著差异，然后计算如果假设正确的话，数据变成这样的概率。这个概率被称为P值。 因此，如果p值非常小，我们就有有意义的证据来怀疑双样本t检验的假设可能是错误的。 我们可以用Python轻松地进行任何假设检验。下面的截图使用scipy.stats 模块中的ttest_ind 函数来做双样本t检验。 from scipy.stats import ttest_ind BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_A.isna() ttest_ind(air_df[BM_MV].Temperature,air_df[~BM_MV].Temperature) ''' Ttest_indResult(statistic=0.05646499065315542, pvalue=0.9549726689684548) ''' 正如你在前面的截图中所看到的，要使用ttest_ind() 函数，我们所需要做的就是传递两组数字 。 t检验的p值非常大0.95（满分1），这意味着我们没有任何理由怀疑两组之间的温度值会有意义的不同。这个结论证实了我们用boxplots 和柱状图得出的结论。 在这里，我们展示了仅基于一个数字属性的诊断缺失值的代码。其余数字属性的代码和分析是类似的。现在你知道了如何对一个数字属性进行分析，接下来我们将创建一个代码，输出我们使用数字属性进行缺失值诊断所需要的所有内容。 根据所有数字属性诊断缺失值 为了对缺失值做一个完整的诊断，需要对所有的属性做一个类似于我们对温度属性所做的分析。虽然分析的每一部分都很容易理解和解释，但由于诊断分析有很多部分，这就要求我们用非常有组织的方式进行编码和分析。 为了有条不紊地做到这一点，我们将首先创建一个函数，执行我们显示的可以对温度进行的所有三种分析。除了数据集之外，该函数还接受我们要进行分析的数字属性的名称和布尔掩码，对于有缺失值的数据对象，该掩码为真，对于没有缺失值的数据对象，该掩码为假。该函数输出boxplots、柱状图和输入属性的t检验的p值。下面的截图中的代码显示了这个函数是如何创建的。该代码相当长，如果你想复制它，请在本书专用的GitHub仓库中的第11章数据清理第三级--缺失值、异常值和错误文件夹中找到它。 from scipy.stats import ttest_ind def Diagnose_MV_Numerical(df,str_att_name,BM_MV): MV_labels = {True:'With Missing Values',False:'Without Missing Values'} labels=[] box_sr = pd.Series('',index = BM_MV.unique()) for poss in BM_MV.unique(): BM = BM_MV == poss box_sr[poss] = df[BM][str_att_name].dropna() labels.append(MV_labels[poss]) plt.boxplot(box_sr,vert=False) plt.yticks([1,2],labels) plt.xlabel(str_att_name) plt.show() plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) att_range = (df[str_att_name].min(),df[str_att_name].max()) for i,poss in enumerate(BM_MV.unique()): plt.subplot(1,2,i+1) BM = BM_MV == poss df[BM][str_att_name].hist() plt.xlim = att_range plt.xlabel(str_att_name) plt.title(MV_labels[poss]) plt.show() group_1_data = df[BM_MV][str_att_name].dropna() group_2_data = df[~BM_MV][str_att_name].dropna() p_value = ttest_ind(group_1_data,group_2_data).pvalue print('p-value of t-test: {}'.format(p_value)) 简单地说，前面的代码是图11所示代码的参数化和组合版本。运行前面的代码，即创建一个Diagnose_MV_Numerical() 函数后，运行下面的代码将对数据中的所有数字属性运行这个函数，它允许你调查NO2_Location_A的缺失值是否由于任何与数据集中的数字属性有关的系统性原因而发生。 numerical_attributes = ['Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Wind_Speed', 'Wind_Direction'] BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_A.isna() for att in numerical_attributes: print('Diagnosis Analysis of Missing Values for {}:'.format(att)) Diagnose_MV_Numerical(air_df,att,BM_MV) print('- - - - - - - - - - - - divider - - - - - - - - - - - ') 运行前面的代码将产生四个诊断报告，每个数字属性一个。每份报告有三个部分：使用图表的诊断，使用直方图的诊断，以及使用t检验的诊断。研究前面代码片断的后续报告可以看出，NO2_Location_A下的缺失值的趋势并没有根据数据中任何一个数字属性的值而改变。 接下来，我们将对分类属性做一个类似的编码和分析。就像我们对数字属性所做的那样，让我们先对一个属性进行诊断，然后我们将创建代码，可以一次性输出我们需要的所有分析。我们要做诊断的第一个属性是工作日。 基于工作日的缺失值诊断 你可能会感到困惑，air_df数据集没有一个名为工作日的分类属性，你是对的，但解开air_df.DataTime 属性可以得到以下属性：工作日、日、月和小时。 如果你认为这听起来像是二级数据清理，你是完全正确的。为了能够更有效地进行第三级数据清理，我们需要先进行一些第二级数据清理。下面的代码执行了所述的第二级数据清理。 air_df.DateTime = pd.to_datetime(air_df.DateTime) air_df['month'] = air_df.DateTime.dt.month air_df['day'] = air_df.DateTime.dt.day air_df['hour'] = air_df.DateTime.dt.hour air_df['weekday'] = air_df.DateTime.dt.day_name() air_df.head() 运行前面的代码后，在继续阅读之前，请检查air_df的新状态，并研究被添加到它的新列。你会看到，月、日、小时和工作日的分类属性被解包为它们自己的属性。 现在，这个数据清理二级已经完成，我们可以根据工作日的分类属性，对air_df.NO2_Location_A列的缺失值进行诊断。 正如我们在第五章 \"数据可视化 \"中所看到的，柱状图是一种数据可视化技术，可以根据分类属性来比较人群。下面的截图显示了我们在第5章 \"数据可视化 \"中所学到的，在使用条形图比较人群的例子中，对这种情况的第一种方式进行了修改。 BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_A.isna() MV_labels = ['Without Missing Values','With Missing Values'] plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) for i,poss in enumerate(BM_MV.unique()): plt.subplot(1,2,i+1) BM = BM_MV == poss air_df[BM].weekday.value_counts().plot.bar() plt.title(MV_labels[i]) plt.show() 观察前面的截图，我们可以看到缺失值可能是随机发生的，我们没有一个有意义的趋势来相信缺失值的发生有一个系统性的原因，是由于airt_df.weekday 的值的变化。 我们也可以用独立度的卡方检验统计测试来做类似的诊断。 简而言之，对于这种情况，该检验假设缺失值的发生与工作日属性之间没有关系。基于这一假设，该检验计算出一个p值，即如果假设为真，我们所拥有的数据发生的概率。利用这个p值，我们可以决定我们是否有任何证据来怀疑缺失值的系统原因。 什么是P值？这是我们在本章中第二次看到P值的概念。 在所有的统计测试中，P值是同一个概念，它具有相同的意义。每个统计检验都会假设一些东西（这被称为空假设），而p值是根据这个假设和观察结果（数据）计算出来的。p值是指如果无效假设为真，已经发生的数据的概率。 使用p值的一个流行经验法则是采用著名的5%的显著性水平。0.05的显著性水平表示，如果p值结果大于0.05，那么我们就没有任何证据来怀疑无效假设不正确。虽然这是一个相当好的经验法则，但最好是了解p值，然后用数据可视化来补充统计测试。 下面的截图显示了使用scipy.stats 中的chi2_contingency() 进行的独立性的卡方检验。代码首先使用pd.crosstab() 来创建一个或然率表，它是一个可视化工具，用来研究两个分类属性之间的关系（这在第5章数据可视化中的可视化两个分类属性之间的关系部分有介绍）。然后，代码将contigency_table 传递给chi2_contingency() 函数来进行测试。该测试输出一些数值，但不是所有的数值都对我们有用。p值是第二个值，是0.4127。 from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_A.isna() contigency_table = pd.crosstab(BM_MV,air_df.weekday) contigency_table chi2_contingency(contigency_table) ''' (6.048964133655503, 0.41772751510388023, 6, array([[1230.95081967, 1230.95081967, 1230.95081967, 1230.95081967, 1254.62295082, 1230.95081967, 1254.62295082], [ 17.04918033, 17.04918033, 17.04918033, 17.04918033, 17.37704918, 17.04918033, 17.37704918]])) ''' 拥有0.4127的p值证实了我们在图11.10下的观察，即air_df.NO2_Location_A 中缺失值的发生与工作日的值之间没有关系，缺失值发生的方式可能只是一个随机的机会。 在这里，我们展示了只基于一个分类属性的诊断缺失值的代码。其余分类属性的代码和分析是类似的。现在你知道了如何对一个数字属性进行诊断，接下来我们将创建一个代码，输出我们使用分类属性进行缺失值诊断所需要的所有信息。 根据所有的分类属性来诊断缺失值 为了对缺失值做一个完整的诊断，需要对所有其他的分类属性做一个类似于我们对Weekday属性所做的分析。为了有条不紊地完成这项工作，我们将首先创建一个函数，执行我们所展示的对工作日进行的两项分析。除了数据集之外，该函数还接收我们想要进行分析的分类属性的名称和布尔掩码，对于有缺失值的数据对象，掩码为真，对于没有缺失值的数据对象，掩码为假。该函数输出条形图，以及输入属性的独立度卡方检验的p值。下面的代码片断显示了这个函数是如何创建的。 from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency def Diagnose_MV_Categorical(df,str_att_name,BM_MV): MV_labels = {True:'With Missing Values',False:'Without Missing Values'} plt.figure(figsize=(10,4)) for i,poss in enumerate(BM_MV.unique()): plt.subplot(1,2,i+1) BM = BM_MV == poss df[BM][str_att_name].value_counts().plot.bar() plt.title(MV_labels[poss]) plt.show() contigency_table = pd.crosstab(BM_MV,df[str_att_name]) p_value = chi2_contingency(contigency_table)[1] print('p-value of Chi_squared test: {}'.format(p_value)) 运行前面的代码，即创建一个Diagnose_MV_Categorical() 函数后，运行下面的代码将对数据中的所有分类属性运行这个函数，它允许你调查NO2_Location_A 的缺失值是否是由于任何与数据集中的分类属性有关的系统原因而发生的。 categorical_attributes = ['month', 'day','hour', 'weekday'] BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_A.isna() for att in categorical_attributes: print('Diagnosis Analysis of Missing Values for {}:'.format(att)) Diagnose_MV_Categorical(air_df,att,BM_MV) print('- - - - - - - - - - - - divider - - - - - - - - - - - ') 当你运行前面的代码时，它将产生四个诊断报告，每个分类属性一个报告。每个报告都有两部分，如下所示。 - 使用条形图进行诊断 - 使用独立的卡方检验进行诊断 研究这些报告表明， NO2_Location_A 下的缺失值的趋势并没有根据数据中任何一个分类属性的值而改变。 结合我们在本章前面对数字属性的学习和刚才对分类属性的学习，我们确实看到数据中的任何一个属性--即温度、湿度、风速、风向、工作日、日、月和小时--都不可能影响缺失值的趋势。 根据我们对缺失值进行的所有诊断，我们得出结论，NO2_Location_A 的缺失值属于MCAR类型。 现在我们已经能够确定NO2_Location_A 的缺失值，让我们也对NO2_Location_B 和NO2_Location_C 的缺失值运行我们迄今为止学到的诊断。我们将在下面两个小节中这样做。 1.5.2 诊断NO2_Location_B的缺失值 为了诊断NO2_Location_B的缺失值，我们需要做与NO2_Location_A完全相同的分析。编码部分非常容易，因为我们已经做了这些，大部分都是这样。下面的代码使用我们已经创建的Diagnose_MV_Numerical() 和Diagnose_MV_Categorical() 函数来运行所有需要的诊断，以便找出NO2_Location_B 下发生的缺失值类型。 categorical_attributes = ['month', 'day','hour', 'weekday'] numerical_attributes = ['Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Wind_Speed', 'Wind_Direction'] BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_B.isna() for att in numerical_attributes: print('Diagnosis Analysis of Missing Values for {}:'.format(att)) Diagnose_MV_Numerical(air_df,att,BM_MV) print('- - - - - - - - - - - - divider - - - - - - - - - - - ') for att in categorical_attributes: print('Diagnosis Analysis of Missing Values for {}:'.format(att)) Diagnose_MV_Categorical(air_df,att,BM_MV) print('- - - - - - - - - - - - divider - - - - - - - - - - - ') 当你运行前面的代码时，会产生一个长报告，调查缺失值的发生趋势是否受到任何分类或数字属性值的影响。 在研究了该报告之后，你可以看到有几个属性似乎与缺失值的发生有意义的关系。这些属性是温度、风速、风向和月份。下面的截图显示了对风速的诊断分析，它与缺失值的关系最强。 在前面的截图中，你可以看到所有三个分析工具都显示，在NO2_Location_B下有缺失值的数据对象和没有缺失值的数据对象之间，风速的值存在着明显的差异。简而言之，较高的Wind_Speed值往往会增加NO2_Location_B有缺失值的机会。 在这次诊断之后，将结果与卖给我们空气质量传感器的公司分享。以下是发给该公司的电子邮件。 亲爱的先生/女士，我写这封邮件是为了与您分享我们从您那里购买的序列号为231703612的电化学传感器似乎出现了故障模式。当温度较低，而风速较高时，传感器似乎会跳过记录。我们想让你知道，如果你能告诉我们你对这种模式的看法，我们将不胜感激。 真诚的，Iman Ahmadian 几天后，我们收到以下电子邮件。 尊敬的分析团队，感谢您分享您的关注和有关电化学传感器问题的信息。 你与我们分享的内容与我们最近的发现是一致的。我们已经了解到，你所列出的传感器的型号在大风条件下往往会出现故障。 对于未来的案例，你会期望序列号以2317开头的传感器遇到类似的问题。 我们对这种不便表示诚挚的歉意，并将非常乐意为您提供50%的折扣，购买我们没有这种故障的全新传感器。如果您希望使用这一折扣，请引用这封电子邮件与我们的销售部门联系。 最好的祝愿 尼玛-加德利 我们有了--现在我们知道为什么NO2_Location_B下的一些缺失值会发生。我们知道，温度值会导致缺失值的增加，所以我们可以得出结论，NO2_Location_B下的缺失值是MAR类型的。 这里要问的一个好问题是，如果高风速值是造成缺失值的罪魁祸首，为什么缺失值也显示出与温度、风向和月份有意义的模式？原因是 \"风速 \"与 \"温度\"、\"风向 \"和 \"月份 \"有密切关系。利用你在第5章 \"数据可视化 \"中 \"调查两个属性之间的关系 \"一节中所学到的知识，将其纳入分析。由于这些强烈的关系，看起来好像其他属性也会影响缺失值的趋势。我们从与传感器制造商的沟通中得知，情况并非如此。 到目前为止，我们已经能够诊断出NO2_Location_A和NO2_Location_B下的缺失值。接下来，我们将对NO2_Location_C进行诊断。 1.5.3诊断NO2_Location_C的缺失值 我们只需要改变NO2_Location_B中诊断缺失值的代码中的一行，这样我们就可以诊断出NO2_Location_C中的缺失值。你需要将第三行代码从BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_B.isna() 改为BM_MV = air_df.NO2_Location_C.isna() 。一旦这个变化被应用，代码被运行，你将得到一个基于数据中所有分类和数字属性的诊断报告。在继续阅读之前，请尝试浏览并解释诊断报告。 诊断报告显示了缺失值的趋势与大多数属性之间的关系--即温度、湿度、风速、日、月、小时和工作日。然而，与工作日属性的关系是最强的。下面的截图显示了一个基于工作日的缺失值诊断。 截图中的柱状图显示，缺失值只发生在星期六。卡方检验的P值非常小。 基于小时和日的诊断也显示出有意义的模式（这里没有打印小时和日属性的诊断报告，但请看你刚刚创建的报告）。只有当小时属性的值为10、11、12、13、14、15、16、17、18、19和20时，或者当日属性的值为25、26、27、28和29时，缺失值才同样发生。从这些报告中，我们可以推断出，缺失值可预测地发生在每个月的最后一个星期六，从上午10点到晚上8点。 这就是我们在数据中看到的模式，但为什么呢？ 在让C地的地方当局知道后，发现C地电厂的一群员工一直在利用电厂的资源从事各种加密货币的挖掘。这种滥用资源的行为只发生在每月的最后一个星期六，因为该电厂有一整天的时间进行定期和预防性维护。由于这群员工为了掩盖他们的行踪和避免被抓，他们决定篡改为调节电厂空气污染而设置的传感器。他们不知道，篡改数据收集会在数据集上留下痕迹，而这种痕迹不容易从像你这样的高质量数据分析师的眼中隐藏。 这最后一条信息和诊断结果使我们得出结论：NO2_Location_C的缺失值是一个MNAR值。这样的值被遗漏是由于一个直接的原因，即为什么首先要收集数据。很多时候，当一个数据集有大量的MNAR缺失值时，这个数据集就会变得毫无价值，无法起到有意义的分析作用。处理MNAR缺失值的第一步是防止它们再次发生。 在学习了如何检测和诊断缺失值之后，现在是讨论处理缺失值的最佳时机。让我们直接开始吧。 1.6 处理缺失值的问题 如以下列表所示，有四种不同的方法来处理缺失值。 - 保持原样。 - 删除有缺失值的数据对象（行）。 - 删除有缺失值的属性（列）。 - 估算和归纳一个值。 在不同的情况下，前面的每种策略都可能是最好的策略。 不管怎么样，在处理缺失值时，我们有以下两个目标。 - 尽可能多地保留数据和信息 - 在我们的分析中引入尽可能少的偏差 同时实现这两个目标并不总是可能的，往往需要取得一种平衡。为了在处理缺失值时有效地找到这种平衡，我们需要了解并考虑以下项目。 - 我们的分析目标 - 我们的分析工具 - 造成缺失值的原因 - 缺失值的类型（MCAR，MAR，MNAR） 在大多数情况下，如果对前面的项目有足够的了解，处理缺失值的最佳行动方案就会展现在你面前。在下面的小节中，我们将首先介绍处理缺失值的四种方法中的每一种，然后我们将通过一些例子把我们所学到的知识付诸实践。 1.6.1 第一种方法--保持缺失值的原样 如标题所示，这种方法将缺失值作为缺失值保留，并进入下一阶段的数据预处理。在以下两种情况下，这种方法是处理缺失值的最佳方式。 首先，在你将与他人分享这些数据，而你不一定是要使用这些数据进行分析的人的情况下，你会使用这种策略。通过这种方式，你将允许他们根据自己的分析需要来决定如何处理缺失值。 第二，如果你的数据分析目标和将要使用的数据分析工具都能无缝处理缺失值，保持原样是最好的方法。例如，我们在第7章 \"分类 \"中了解到的K-Nearest Neighbors（KNN）算法，可以被调整来处理缺失值，而不必删除任何数据对象。正如你所记得的，KNN计算数据对象之间的距离来寻找最近的邻居。 因此，每次在计算一个有缺失值的数据对象和其他数据对象之间的距离时，都会为缺失值假设一个值。假设值的选择方式是，假设值不会有帮助，所以具有缺失值的数据对象将被选中。换句话说，只有当一个有缺失值的数据对象的非缺失值显示出非常高的相似度，抵消了缺失值的假设值的负面作用时，它才会被选为最近的邻居之一。 1.6.2 第二种方法--删除有缺失值的数据对象 这种方法的选择必须非常谨慎，因为它可能会违背成功处理缺失值的两个目标：不向数据集引入偏见，不从数据中删除有价值的信息。例如，当数据集中的缺失值属于MNAR或MAR类型时，我们应该避免删除缺失值的数据对象。这是因为这样做意味着你正在删除数据集中有意义的不同部分的人口。 即使缺失值是MCAR类型的，我们也应该首先尝试找到其他处理缺失值的方法，然后再转向删除数据对象。当没有其他方法来处理缺失值时，从数据集中删除数据对象应该被视为最后的手段。 1.6.3 第三种方法--删除缺失值的属性 当一个数据集中的大部分缺失值都来自于一两个属性时，我们可以考虑删除这些属性作为处理缺失值的一种方式。当然，如果该属性是一个关键属性，没有它你就无法进行项目，那么面对关键属性中太多的缺失值就意味着项目无法进行。但是，如果这些属性对项目来说不是绝对必要的，那么删除缺失值太多的属性可能是正确的做法。 当一个属性的缺失值数量足够多时（大概超过25%），估计和输入缺失值就变得毫无意义，放任该属性比估计缺失值要好。 1.6.4 第四种方法--估计和归纳缺失值 在这种方法中，我们将利用我们的知识、理解和分析工具来填补缺失的价值。术语imputing抓住了这样做对数据集的本质--我们用数值代替缺失值，同时知道这可能会导致我们的分析出现偏差。 如果缺失值是MCAR或MAR类型的，而我们选择的分析方法不能处理缺失值的数据集，那么归纳缺失值可能是最好的方法。 有四种一般的方法来估计缺失值的替代。下面的清单概述了这些方法。 - 用一般的中心趋势（平均数、中位数或模式）进行估算。这对MCAR缺失值来说是比较好的。 - 用与缺失值更相关的一组数据的中心趋势来替代。这对MAR缺失值来说比较好。 - 回归分析。不太理想，但如果我们必须对有MNAR缺失值的数据集进行处理，这种方法对这样的数据集比较好。 - 内插法。当数据集是一个时间序列数据集，并且缺失值是MCAR类型的。 关于估计和估算过程的一个常见的误解是，我们要用最准确的替代物来估算缺失值。这是不正确的。 归因时，我们的目的不是要最好地预测缺失值，而是要用对我们的分析产生最少偏差的值来归因。例如，对于聚类分析来说，如果一个数据集有MCAR缺失值，那么用整个人口的中心趋势进行估算是最好的方法。原因是中心趋势值在对数据对象进行分组的过程中会起到中立投票的作用，如果有缺失值的数据对象被推到了一个聚类中，这并不是由于估算值的原因。 现在我们已经有机会了解处理缺失值的不同方法，让我们把事情放在一起，看看在选择正确策略时的逐步决策过程。 1.6.5 在处理缺失值时选择正确的方法 下图总结了我们到目前为止在处理缺失值方面所讨论的内容。该图显示，在处理缺失值时，必须从四个方面选择正确的方法：分析目标、分析工具、缺失值的原因和缺失值的类型（MCAR、MAR、MNAR）。 1.6.6 例子1 使用air_df，我们在本章前面检测并诊断了其缺失值，我们想画一个柱状图，显示地点A的每小时平均二氧化氮值。 如果你还记得，air_df.NO2_Location_A 中的缺失值属于MCAR 缺失值类型。由于缺失值不属于MNAR类型，而且柱状图可以很容易地处理缺失值，所以我们选择的处理缺失值的策略将是保持其原样。下面的截图显示了代码和它所创建的柱状图。 air_df.groupby('hour').NO2_Location_A.mean().plot.bar() plt.show() 在前面的截图中，你观察到.groupby() 和.mean() 函数能够处理缺失值。当数据被聚合且缺失值的数量不多时，数据的聚合处理缺失值，而不需要进行归集。事实上，.mean() 函数忽略了有缺失值的属性的存在，并根据有值的数据对象计算出平均值。 1.6.7 例子2 使用air_df，我们在本章前面检测并诊断了其缺失值，我们想画一张线图，比较地点A每个月第一天的二氧化氮变化。 我们知道air_df.NO2_Location_A 中的缺失值是MCAR类型的；但是，假设我们不知道线图是否能处理缺失值。因此，让我们试一试，看看保持原样的策略是否有效。下面的截图显示了我们需要的线段图，没有处理缺失值。 month_poss = air_df.month.unique() hour_poss = air_df.hour.unique() plt.figure(figsize=(15,4)) for mn in month_poss: BM = (air_df.month == mn) & (air_df.day ==1) wdf = air_df[BM] plt.plot(wdf.NO2_Location_A.values, label=mn) plt.legend(ncol=6) plt.xticks(hour_poss) plt.show() 在前面的截图中，我们看到，由于存在缺失值，线图在中间被切断。如果该图符合我们的分析需要，那么我们就完成了，不需要再做什么。但是，如果我们想处理缺失值并消除线图中的空点，我们就需要使用插值，因为缺失值是MCAR类型的，而且数据是时间序列数据。下面的代码片断显示了如何处理缺失值，然后绘制完整的线图。 NO2_Location_A_noMV = air_df.NO2_Location_A.interpolate(method='linear') month_poss = air_df.month.unique() hour_poss = air_df.hour.unique() plt.figure(figsize=(15,4)) for mn in month_poss: BM = (air_df.month == mn) & (air_df.day ==1) plt.plot(NO2_Location_A_noMV[BM].values, label=mn) plt.legend(ncol=6) plt.xticks(hour_poss) plt.show() 前面的代码片断使用.interploate() 函数来估算缺失值。当使用method='linear' 时，该函数用其前后的数据点的平均值进行估算。在我们眼里，这将显得好像空点是用尺子连接起来的一样。 1.6.8 例子3 使用air_df ，我们想画一个条形图，比较地点A和地点B的每小时平均二氧化氮值。 我们记得，air_df.NO2_Location_A 中的缺失值是MCAR类型的，而air_df.NO2_Location_B 中的缺失值是MAR类型的。由于这两个属性都没有MNAR缺失值，而且条形图可以处理缺失值，我们可以使用保持原样的策略。下面的截图显示了为这种情况创建条形图所需的代码。 air_df.groupby('hour')[['NO2_Location_A','NO2_Location_B','NO2_Location_C']].mean().plot.bar() plt.show() 1.6.8 例子4 使用air_df，我们想画一个条形图，比较地点A、地点B和地点C的每小时平均二氧化氮值。 我们记得，在NO2_Location_A、NO2_Location_B和NO2_Location_C中，缺失值的类型分别为MCAR、MAR和MNAR。正如我们提到的，处理MCAR和MAR缺失值比处理MNAR缺失值要容易得多。对于MCAR和MAR，我们已经看到，我们可以使用保持原样的策略。 对于MNAR，我们需要回答这个问题。MNAR的缺失值是基本属性吗？回答这个问题需要对分析目标有一个深刻的理解。在两种不同的分析情况下，我们可能需要以不同的方式来处理缺失值。 在一个分析情境中，一个空气污染监管政府机构要求提供柱状图。在这种情况下，我们不能越过NO2_Location_C中的MNAR缺失值，我们需要拒绝他们的请求，而是将缺失值的存在告知监管机构，而不是发送他们所要求的东西。这是因为柱状图会产生误导，因为缺失值是由于数据被篡改，目的是为了淡化空气污染数据。 在另一种情况下，一个想调查不同地区一般空气污染的研究人员要求提供柱状图。在这种情况下，即使缺失值属于MNAR类型，但其背后的系统性原因对我们的分析目标并不重要。因此，我们可以对所有三栏采用保持原状的策略。创建柱状图与我们在图11.17中所做的非常相似。运行air_df.groupby('hour') [['NO2_Location_A', 'NO2_Location_B', 'NO2_Location_C']].mean() 。plot.bar() 将创建所要求的视觉效果。 1.6.9 例子5 我们想用kidney_disease.csv 数据集来对慢性肾脏病（CKD）和非CKD的病例进行分类。该数据集显示了400名患者的数据，有5个独立的属性--即红细胞（rc）、血清肌酐（sc）、包装细胞容积（pcv）、比重（sg）和血红蛋白（hemo）。当然，该数据集也有一个名为诊断的从属属性，患者被标记为CKD或非CKD。决策树是我们想要使用的分类算法。 在我们对数据集的初步观察中，我们注意到数据集有缺失值，在使用我们在检测缺失值下学到的代码后，我们得出结论，rc、sc、pcv、sg和hemo的缺失值数量分别为131、17、71、47和52。 这意味着rc、sc、pcv、sg和hemo的缺失值的百分比分别为32.75%、4.25%、17.75%、11.75%和13%。 在继续阅读之前，利用你在本章中所学到的知识来确认前一段的信息。 patient_df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Data-Preprocessing-in-Python/main/Chapter11/kidney_disease.csv') patient_df.head() print('Number of missing values:') for col in patient_df.columns: n_MV = sum(patient_df[col].isna()) print('{}:{}'.format(col,n_MV)) 当不同属性的缺失值数量较多（超过15%）时，可能大部分缺失值都发生在相同的数据对象上，这对我们的分析来说可能会有很大的问题。因此，在对每个属性的缺失值进行诊断之前，让我们使用seaborn模块中的heatmap() 函数来可视化整个数据集的缺失值。下面的截图显示了代码和它产生的热图。 plt.figure(figsize=(4,7)) sns.heatmap(patient_df.isna()) plt.show() 前面截图中的热图显示，缺失值在一定程度上分散在各个数据对象中，当然也不是说不同属性下的缺失值只来自特定的数据对象。 接下来，我们把注意力转向每个属性的缺失值诊断。在执行了本章所学的内容后，我们可以得出结论，sc属性的缺失值属于MCAR类型，而rc、pcv、sg和hemo的缺失值属于MAR类型。所有MAR缺失值的趋势都与诊断依赖属性高度相关。 categorical_attributes = ['diagnosis'] numerical_attributes = ['sc','pcv','sg','hemo'] BM_MV = patient_df.rc.isna() for att in numerical_attributes: print('Diagnosis Analysis for {}:'.format(att)) Diagnose_MV_Numerical(patient_df,att,BM_MV) print('- - - - - - - - - divider - - - - - - - - ') for att in categorical_attributes: print('Diagnosis Analysis for {}:'.format(att)) Diagnose_MV_Categorical(patient_df,att,BM_MV) print('- - - - - - - - - divider - - - - - - - - - ') categorical_attributes = ['diagnosis'] numerical_attributes = ['rc','sc','sg','hemo'] BM_MV = patient_df.pcv.isna() for att in numerical_attributes: print('Diagnosis Analysis for {}:'.format(att)) Diagnose_MV_Numerical(patient_df,att,BM_MV) print('- - - - - - - - - divider - - - - - - - - ') for att in categorical_attributes: print('Diagnosis Analysis for {}:'.format(att)) Diagnose_MV_Categorical(patient_df,att,BM_MV) print('- - - - - - - - - divider - - - - - - - - - ') 现在我们对缺失值的类型有了更好的了解，我们需要把注意力转向分析目标和工具的本质。我们想用决策树算法进行分类。当我们想要处理缺失值时，在算法中使用数据集之前，我们需要首先考虑算法如何使用数据，然后尝试选择一种策略，同时优化处理缺失值的两个目标。让我们来提醒自己处理缺失值的两个目标，如下所示。 - 尽可能多地保留数据和信息 - 在我们的分析中引入尽可能少的偏差 我们知道，决策树本身并不是为处理缺失值而设计的，我们所知道的决策树算法的工具--来自sklearn.tree 模块的DecisionTreeClassifier() 函数--如果输入数据有缺失值，会给出一个错误。知道了这一点，我们就知道保持原样的策略是不可行的。 我们也刚刚意识到，一些缺失值的趋势 可以成为因果属性的预测因素。这一点很重要，因为如果我们要对缺失值进行归算，那就会从数据集中删除这一有价值的信息；有价值的信息是，一些属性的缺失值（MAR的）可以预测因果属性。因此，无论我们使用哪种归因方法，我们都将为每个有MAR缺失值的属性在数据集中添加一个二元属性，描述该属性是否有缺失值。这些新的二进制属性将被添加到分类任务的独立属性中，以预测诊断依赖属性。 下面的代码片段显示了这些二进制属性被添加到patient_df 数据集中。 patient_df['rc_BMV'] = patient_df.rc.isna().astype(int) patient_df['pcv_BMV'] = patient_df.pcv.isna().astype(int) patient_df['sg_BMV'] = patient_df.sg.isna().astype(int) patient_df['hemo_BMV'] = patient_df.hemo.isna().astype(int) 在继续阅读之前，先运行前面的几行代码，研究一下patient_df 的状态。 现在让我们把注意力转向缺失值的归纳。如果你不记得决策树算法是如何完成分类任务的，请在继续阅读之前回到第7章，分类，以唤起你的记忆。决策树算法根据属性值将数据对象连续分成几组，当数据对象的值大于或小于属性的中心倾向时，它们更有可能被归入一个特定的标签。因此，通过用属性的中心趋势进行估算，我们不会给数据集引入偏见，所以估算的值不会导致分类器更频繁地预测一个标签而不是另一个。 因此，我们得出结论，用属性的中心趋势进行估算是解决缺失值的一种合理方式。我们现在需要回答的问题是。我们应该使用哪种中心趋势--中位数还是平均值？这个问题的答案是，如果属性没有很多离群值，那么平均数会更好。 在调查了有缺失值的属性的boxplots之后，你会发现sc有太多的离群值，而其余的属性都没有高度偏斜。因此，下面的代码片段显示了用patient_df.sc.median() 对patient_df.sc 的缺失值进行估算，并对其余有缺失值的属性用其平均值进行估算。 numerical_attributes = ['pcv','rc','sc','sg','hemo'] for att in numerical_attributes: patient_df[att].plot.box(vert=False) plt.show() patient_df.sc.fillna(patient_df.sc.median(),inplace=True) patient_df.fillna(patient_df.mean(),inplace=True) 前面的代码片段使用了.fillna() 函数，这在估算缺失值时非常有用。运行前面的代码后，重新创建图11.18所示的热图，看看你的数据中缺失值的状况。 plt.figure(figsize=(4,7)) sns.heatmap(patient_df.isna()) plt.show() 吁! 检测、诊断和处理缺失值的工作现在已经完成了。现在，数据集已经为分类任务进行了预处理。我们需要做的就是使用我们在第7章 \"分类 \"中学到的代码来运行决策树算法。 下面的代码片段显示了第七章 \"分类 \"中针对这种分析情况所修改的代码。 from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree predictors = ['rc', 'sc', 'pcv', 'sg', 'hemo', 'rc_BMV', 'pcv_BMV', 'sg_BMV', 'hemo_BMV'] target = 'diagnosis' Xs = patient_df[predictors] y= patient_df[target] classTree = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_impurity_decrease= 0.01, min_samples_split= 15) classTree.fit(Xs, y) 前面的代码片段创建了一个决策树模型，并使用我们预处理的数据对其进行训练。请注意，min_impurity_decrease= 0.01 和min_samples_split= 15 是决策树算法的超参数，使用调整过程来调整。 下面的代码片段使用classTree训练的决策树模型，直观地画出它的树形，以供分析和使用。 from sklearn.tree import plot_tree plt.figure(figsize=(15,15)) plot_tree(classTree, feature_names=predictors, class_names=y.unique(), filled=True, impurity=False) plt.show() 现在我们可以使用前面的决策树来对来院的病人进行决策。 到目前为止，你在本章中已经取得了很大的进展。你现在已经能够从技术和分析的角度检测、诊断和处理缺失值了。在本章中，我们将讨论极端点和离群点的问题。 2 异常值 离群值，又称极端点，是指其数值与其他数据对象差异过大的数据对象。能够识别和处理它们，从以下三个角度来看是很重要的。 - 离群点可能是数据中的数据错误，应该被检测和删除。 - 不是错误的离群值会使对离群值存在敏感的分析工具的结果产生偏差。 - 离群值可能是欺诈性的条目。 我们将首先介绍我们可以用来检测异常值的工具，然后我们将介绍根据分析情况处理异常值的方法 2.1 检测异常值 我们用于检测离群值的工具取决于所涉及的属性数量。如果我们只对基于一个属性的异常值检测感兴趣，我们称之为单变量异常值检测；如果我们想基于两个属性检测，我们称之为双变量异常值检测；最后，如果我们想基于两个以上的属性检测异常值，我们称之为多变量异常值检测。我们将介绍我们可以用于上述每个类别的离群点检测的工具。我们还将介绍检测时间序列数据的异常值，因为在这方面有更好的工具。 2.1.1 单变量离群点检测 我们将用于单变量异常值检测的工具取决于属性的类型。对于数值属性，我们可以使用箱线图或[Q1-1.5*IQR, Q3+1.5*IQR] 统计范围。异常值的概念对于单一的分类属性没有太大意义，但我们可以使用频率表或条形图等工具。 下面两个例子的特点是单变量离群点检测。在这些例子中，我们将使用 responses.csv 和 columns.csv 文件。这两个文件用于记录在斯洛伐克进行的一项调查的日期。 由于一级数据清理的原因，该数据集使用两个文件来保存记录--直观的和可编码的属性名称。columns.csv文件保留了可编码的属性名称及其完整的标题，而response.csv文件有一个数据对象（调查回应）表，其属性使用可编码的标题来命名。 下面的截图显示了将这两个文件读入Pandas DataFrames以及两个DataFrames的前两行。 检测一个数字属性的异常值的例子 在这个例子中，我们想检测response_df.Weight 数字属性中的异常值。我们有两种方法可以做到这一点；两种方法都会导致相同的结论。第一种方法是可视化的；我们将使用一个boxplot 。下面的截图显示了为response_df.Weight 创建一个boxplot的代码。 在下限之前和上限之后的圆圈代表数据中与其他数字在统计学上有太大差异的数据对象。这些圆圈在boxplot分析中被称为传单。 我们可以通过不同的方式来访问boxplot中作为传单的数据对象。 首先，我们可以从视觉上做到这一点。我们可以看到，传单的Weight值大于105，所以我们可以使用布尔掩码来过滤掉这些数据对象。运行response_df[response_df.Weight>105] 将列出前面截图中呈现的异常值。 其次，我们可以直接从boxplot本身访问离群值。如果你注意前面的截图，你会注意到在本书中第一次将绘图函数的输出--这里是plt.boxplot() --分配给一个新变量--这里是fig。这样做的原因是，到目前为止，数据可视化的最终目标是可视化本身，而我们不需要访问可视化的细节。 然而，在这里，我们想访问传单并找出它们的值，以避免可能的视觉错误。 我们可以以类似的方式访问每个Matplotlib 可视化的所有方面。如果你运行print(fig) 并研究其结果，你会发现fig是一个字典，其键是可视化的不同元素。由于本例中的可视化是一个boxplot，其元素是cap 、whiskers 、fliers 、box 和median 。每个键都与一个或多个matplotlib.lines.Line2D 编程对象的列表有关。这是一个Matplotlib 在其内部流程中使用的编程对象，但在这里我们想用它来给我们提供fliers的值。每个matplotlib.lines.Line2D 对象都有.get_data() 函数，可以给你显示在绘图上的值。例如，运行fig['fliers'][0].get_data() 可以得到图11.21中显示为fliers 的重量值。 print(fig) ''' {'whiskers': [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x0000020F9E7773A0>, <matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x0000020F9E296F10>], 'caps': [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x0000020F9E296DF0>, <matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x0000020F9E296490>], 'boxes': [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x0000020F9E777A90>], 'medians': [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x0000020F9E296820>], 'fliers': [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x0000020F9E892F40>], 'means': []} ''' fig['fliers'][0].get_data() ''' (array([120., 110., 111., 120., 113., 125., 165., 120., 150.]), array([1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])) ''' 我们不需要用boxplot来寻找离群值。膨胀图本身使用以下公式来计算膨胀图的上限和下限。Q1和Q3是数据的第一和第三季度。 任何不在上限和下限之间的东西都将被标记为离群值。 下面的代码使用.quantile() 函数和前面的公式来输出离群值。 Q1 = response_df.Weight.quantile(0.25) Q3 = response_df.Weight.quantile(0.75) IQR = Q3-Q1 BM = (response_df.Weight > (Q3+1.5 *IQR)) | (response_df.Weight < (Q1-1.5 *IQR)) response_df[BM] 使用我们在这个例子中涉及的两种方法中的任何一种，你会发现有九个数据对象的Weight值在统计学上与其他数据对象相差太大。这些异常值的Weight值是120、110、111、120、113、125、165、120和150。在继续阅读之前，请确保使用这两种方法确认这一点。 接下来，我们将看到一个例子，展示基于一个分类属性检测异常值的情况。 检测一个分类属性的异常值的例子 在这个例子中，我们想检测 response_df.Education 分类属性中的离群值。为了检测一个分类属性中的异常值，我们可以使用频率表或条形图。正如我们在第5章 \"数据可视化 \"中所学到的，你可以运行response_df.Education.value_counts() 来获得一个频率表，而运行response_df.Education.value_counts().plot.bar() 将创建一个条形图。运行这两行代码，以确认教育值为博士学位的数据对象在这一分类属性中是一个异常值。 现在我们已经具备了单变量离群点检测的工具。让我们把注意力转向双变量离群点检测。 response_df.Education.value_counts().plot.bar() 2.1.2 双变量离群点检测 由于单变量离群值检测只涉及一个属性，双变量离群值检测则涉及两个属性。在双变量离群点检测中，离群点是指其两个属性的数值组合与其他属性差别过大的数据对象。与单变量离群值检测类似，我们将用于双变量离群值检测的工具取决于属性的类型。对于数字-数字属性，最好使用散点图；对于数字-分类属性，最好使用多个boxplots；对于分类-分类属性，我们使用的工具是彩色编码的或然率表。 以下三个例子的特点是分类和数字属性的三种可能配对组合中的一种。 检测两个数字属性中的异常值的例子 在这个例子中，我们想检测由两个数字属性（response_df.Height和response_df.Weight） 描述的离群值时。在检测两个数字属性的异常值时，最好使用散点图。运行 response_df.plot.scatter(x='Weight', y='Height') 将导致以下输出。 response_df.plot.scatter(x='Height',y='Weight') 根据前面的截图，我们可以清楚地看到两个离群值，一个是重量值大于120，另一个是高度值小于70。为了过滤掉这两个异常值，我们可以使用一个布尔掩码。下面的代码片断显示了如何做到这一点。 BM = (response_df.Weight>130) | (response_df.Height<70) response_df[BM] 当前面的代码运行时，你会看到三个数据对象。如果你检查这些数据对象的身高和体重值，你会看到其中一个对象的身高值是缺失的，因此没有显示在散点图上。 这个例子的特点是，当两个属性是数字时，进行双变量离群检测。下一个例子是两个属性为分类时的双变量离群点检测。 检测两个分类属性中的异常值的例子 在这个例子中，我们想检测两个分类属性的离群值，即 response_df.god 和 response_df.Education 。由于这两个属性是分类的，最好使用或然率表来检测离群值。运行pd.crosstab(response_df['Education'],response_df['God']) 将创建一个或然率表。为了帮助看到异常值，你可以通过使用seaborn模块中的.heatmap() 将该表变成热图。下面的代码将从或然率表中创建一个热图。 pd.crosstab(response_df['Education'],response_df['God']) cont_table = pd.crosstab(response_df['Education'],response_df['God']) sns.heatmap(cont_table,annot=True, center=0.5 ,cmap=\"Greys\") 从前面的截图中，我们可以看到，有一些情况下，一个数据对象的一些组合值跨越了 response_df.god 和 response_df.Education 。为了过滤掉这些异常值，我们也可以使用一个布尔掩码，但是由于分类属性的值会有很多打字，我们可能最好使用另一个Pandas DataFrame函数。.query() 函数，正如它的名字所示，也可以帮助我们根据属性值对DataFrame进行过滤。 每次运行下面几行代码来过滤掉我们发现的异常值的每个数据对象。 response_df.query('Education== \"currently a primary school pupil\" & God==2') response_df.query('Education== \"currently a primary school pupil\" & God==4') response_df.query('Education== \"doctorate degree\" & God==3') 在这个例子中，我们涵盖了分类-分类的双变量离群点检测。在前面的例子中，我们介绍了数字-数字的双变量离群值检测。接下来，我们将介绍数字-分类双变量离群值检测。 检测两个属性（一个是分类属性，另一个是数字属性）中的异常值的例子 在这个例子中，我们想检测两个属性的离群值，即 response_df.Education 和 response_df.Age 。注意 response_df.Education 是分类的，而 response_df.Age 是数字的。 在对一个数字属性和一个分类属性进行双变量离群检测时，我们使用多个boxplots。实质上，我们将为分类属性的每个类别创建一个横跨数字属性的boxplot。运行sns.boxplot(x=response_df.Age,y=response_df.Education) 将创建以下boxplot，可用于离群点检测。 sns.boxplot(x=response_df.Age,y=response_df.Education) 这是我们在本书中第一次使用sns.boxplot() 。我们确实在第5章 \"数据可视化 \"中学习了如何使用Matplotlib来做这个。在继续阅读之前，请尝试用Matplotlib重新创建boxplot。你会发现，使用seaborn函数要容易得多。 看一下多个boxplots，我们可以看到我们有一些教育类别的离群值：大学/学士学位、中学和小学。为了过滤掉这些异常值，我们可以使用布尔掩码或query()函数。 下面的代码显示了我们如何创建一个布尔掩码来包括所有的传单。 BM1 = (response_df.Education=='college/bachelor degree') & (response_df.Age>26) BM2 = (response_df.Education == 'secondary school') & ((response_df.Age>24) | (response_df.Age<16)) BM3 = (response_df.Education == 'primary school') & ((response_df.Age>19) | (response_df.Age<16)) BM = BM1 | BM2 | BM3 response_df[BM] 2.1.3多变量离群点检测 检测两个以上属性的离群值被称为多变量离群值检测。 进行多元离群点检测的最好方法是通过聚类分析。下面的例子是一个多变量离群点检测的案例。 使用聚类分析检测四个属性的异常值的例子 在这个例子中，我们想看看我们是否有基于以下四个属性的离群值。乡村，音乐，金属或硬摇滚，以及民谣。如果你查看columns_df上对这些属性的完整描述，你会发现这些属性描述了四种音乐中每一种的数据对象的喜欢程度。如前所述，进行多变量离群点检测的最好方法是通过聚类分析。在第8章聚类分析中，我们学习了K-Means算法，在这里，我们将用它来查看我们是否有离群值 如果K-Means将一个数据对象或只有少数数据对象归入一个聚类，这将是我们的线索，即我们的数据中存在多变量的异常值。如果你还记得，K-Means算法的一个很大的弱点是必须指定聚类的数量，即k，。为了确保K-Means算法的弱点不会阻碍有效的离群点检测，并使分析有最好的成功机会，我们将使用不同的k值：2、3、4、5、6和7。我们需要分多个步骤进行，具体如下。 - 首先，我们将创建一个Xs属性，其中包括我们希望用于聚类分析的属性。下面的代码片断显示了这是如何做到的。 dimensions = ['Country', 'Metal or Hardrock','Folk','Musical'] Xs = response_df[dimensions] - 第二，我们需要检查是否有任何缺失的值。你可以使用 Xs.info() 来快速检测缺失值。 Xs.info() - 如果存在缺失值，我们需要做一个与图11.18类似的分析，以检查所有缺失值是否来自其中一个数据对象。如果是这样的话，一个数据对象有两个以上的缺失值，这可能是一个值得关注的理由。然而，如果缺失值似乎是随机发生在Xs之间，我们可以用Q3+1.5*IQR来估算它们。 plt.figure(figsize=(4,7)) sns.heatmap(Xs.isna()) plt.show() 为什么不用中心趋势来归纳呢？我们不这样做的原因是，如果我们用中心趋势进行归因，就会降低有缺失值的数据对象被检测为异常值的可能性。我们不想用我们的缺失值归算来帮助一个有可能成为离群值的数据对象。在这种情况下，缺失值分布在数据对象和Xs的各个维度。因此，我们可以使用下面这行代码，用Q3+IQR*1.5来推算缺失值。 Q3 = Xs.quantile(0.75) Q1 = Xs.quantile(0.25) IQR = Q3 - Q1 Xs = Xs.fillna(Q3+IQR*1.5) - 接下来，我们当然不会忘记用 Xs = (Xs - Xs.min())/(Xs.max()-Xs.min()) 对数据集进行标准化。 - 最后，我们可以用一个循环来对不同的K进行聚类分析并报告其结果。下面一行代码显示了如何做到这一点。 from sklearn.cluster import KMeans for k in range(2,8): kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k) kmeans.fit(Xs) print('k={}'.format(k)) for i in range(k): BM = kmeans.labels_==i print('Cluster {}: {}'.format(i,Xs[BM].index.values)) print('--------- Divider ----------') 一旦前面的代码运行成功，你可以滚动查看它的打印结果，在没有一个Ks下，K-Means将一个数据对象或少数数据对象归入一个群组。这将使我们得出结论，Xs中不存在多元离群点。 2.1.4 时间序列异常点检测 时间序列数据中的异常值最好用线图来检测，原因是时间序列的连续记录之间存在着密切的关系，利用这种密切关系是检查记录正确性的最好方法。你所需要的是对照最接近的连续记录来评估记录的价值，而这很容易用线图来完成。我们将在本章中看到一个时间序列离群点检测的例子--请看本章末尾检测系统误差下的例子。 现在我们已经涵盖了所有三种可能的离群值检测--单变量、双变量和多变量--我们可以把注意力转向处理离群值。 2.2 处理离群值 当我们在要分析的数据集中检测到异常值时，我们还需要有效地处理异常值。下面的列表强调了我们可以用四种方法来处理异常值。 - 什么都不做 - 用上限或下限替换 - 进行对数转换 - 删除有异常值的数据对象 2.2.1 第一种方法--什么都不做 虽然可能没有这种感觉，尤其是在经历了这么多的圈套来检测异常值之后，在大多数分析情况下，什么都不做是最好的策略。原因是，我们使用的大多数分析工具都可以轻松地处理异常值。事实上，如果你知道你想使用的分析工具可以处理异常值，你可能首先就不会进行异常值检测。然而，离群值检测本身可能是你需要的分析方法，或者你需要使用的分析工具容易出现离群值。 下面截图中的表格列出了我们在本书中涉及的所有分析工具/目标，并指定了处理异常值的最佳方法。 正如你在图11.25中看到的，在大多数分析情况下，采用第一种方法会更好：什么都不做。现在，让我们继续，学习下一个方法。 2.2.2 第二种方法--用上盖或下盖替换 当满足以下条件时，应用这种方法可能是明智的。 - 离群值是单变量的。 - 分析目标和/或工具对离群点很敏感。 - 我们不希望因为删除数据对象而丢失信息。 - 值的突然变化不会导致分析结论的重大改变。 如果符合标准，在这种方法中，离群值会被替换成正确的上限或下限。上限和下限是我们在本章前面的单变量离群点检测部分讨论的统计概念。它们也是任何boxplot的一个重要部分。我们用Q1-1.5IQR属性的下限替换比其他数据对象小得多的单变量离群值，用Q3+1.5IQR属性的上限替换比其他数据对象大得多的单变量离群值。 2.2.3 第三种方法--进行对数转换 这种方法不仅仅是一种处理异常值的方法，也是一种有效的数据转换技术，我们将在相关章节中介绍。作为一种处理离群值检测的方法，它只适用于某些情况。当一个属性遵循指数分布时，只有一些数据对象与其他对象有很大的不同才是典型的。在这些情况下，应用对数转换将是最好的方法。 2.2.4 第四种方法--删除有离群值的数据对象 当其他方法无济于事或不可能时，我们可能会沦落到删除带有离群值的数据对象。这是我们最不喜欢的方法，只应在绝对必要时使用。我们希望避免这种方法的原因是，数据并不是不正确的；离群值是正确的，但碰巧与其他人群有太大的不同。这是我们的分析工具没有能力处理实际的人口。 请注意! 至于何时以及是否应该采用删除因是离群值的数据对象的方法，我想与你分享一个重要的建议。首先，只对你为具体分析而创建的数据集的预处理版本应用这种方法，而不是对源数据。 这个分析需要去除有异常值的数据对象的事实并不意味着所有的分析都需要这样做。其次，要优先告知受众所产生的分析结果，因为他们会知道在处理异常值时的这种侵入性方法。 2.2.5 在处理异常值时选择正确的方法 在处理异常值时选择正确的方法，必须从分析目标和分析工具中获得信息。如图11.25所示，在大多数情况下，处理异常值的最好方法是采用不做任何处理的方法。如果其他方法是必要的，请确保只将它们应用于你为分析所创建的数据的预处理版本，而不要改变源数据集。 我们现在知道了处理异常值所需要的一切，所以让我们看几个例子，把我们所学的东西付诸实践。 2.2.6 例子1 我们之前看到 response_df.Weight 属性有一些离群值。我们想用直方图来画出人口在这个属性上的分布。 由于我们分析的最终目标是将人口分布可视化，离群值的存在可能会消耗一些可视化空间，因此，去除离群值可以打开可视化空间。 下面的代码片段及其输出显示了如何为response_df.Weight创建两个直方图版本，一个有离群值，另一个没有。 response_df.Weight.plot.hist(histtype='step') plt.show() BM = response_df.Weight<105 response_df.Weight[BM].plot.hist(histtype='step') plt.show() 在前面的截图中，从分析的角度来看，你可以想象在哪些情况下，这两种视觉效果会更合适。例如，如果我们对看到大多数人口在40和100之间的频率变化感兴趣，那么没有离群值的直方图会更好。另一方面，如果人口的真实代表是我们的最终目标，那么带有离群值的直方图将是理想的。 在前面的截图中，从数据预处理的角度来看，请注意这样一个事实：为了创建一个没有离群值的直方图，我们没有编辑response_df，而是临时创建了一个DataFrame，目的就是为了创建一个没有离群值的直方图。 现在，让我们考虑另一个例子。 2.2.7 例子2 我们想可视化两个属性之间的关系，response_df.Height 和 response_df.weight 。由于这两个属性都是数字的，我们知道可视化这种关系的最佳方法是散点图。我们还希望在可视化中包含线性回归 (LR) 线，以增加其分析值。 我们被告知 LR 容易出现异常值。让我们借此机会了解原因。我们将首先采用什么都不做的方法并创建一个可视化来查看如果数据中有异常值进行回归分析会发生什么。 以下屏幕截图显示了 seaborn 模块中的 .regplot() 函数用于创建散点图可视化的应用程序： sns.regplot(x='Height', y='Weight',data=response_df) plt.show() 你可以在前面的截图中看到，我们在图11.22中检测到的异常值消耗了可视化的空间，不允许关系充分显示。 然而，下面的截图显示了在可视化的最后一步删除离群值的代码。 BM = (response_df.Weight>130) | (response_df.Height<70) sns.regplot(x='Height', y='Weight',data=response_df[~BM]) plt.show() 对比最后两张截图，我们可以看到去除这两个离群值后，可视化可以更好地显示这两个变量之间的关系。你可以在前面的截图中看到，较高的高度值会导致较高的重量值 2.2.8 例子3 在这个例子中，我们想用回归来捕捉体重、身高和性别之间的线性关系来预测体重，这一点我们在前面的例子中看到过。 换句话说，我们想在以下公式中找到β0和β1的值。 正如我们在图11.25中看到的，回归分析对离群值很敏感。我们还在图11.28中观察到，体重和身高都有离群值。我们还需要检查性别是否有离群值。 这将是一个很长的例子，所以请自始至终忍受一下。在这个例子中，我们将逐一讨论以下步骤。 - 处理缺失值 - 检测单变量离群值并处理它们 - 检测双变量离群值并处理它们 - 检测多变量离群值并处理它们 - 应用LR 让我们从第一步开始。 处理缺失值的问题 然而，在这之前，我们首先需要处理这三个属性中的缺失值，因为当输入数据有缺失值时，来自sklearn.linear_model 的LinearRegression 会出现错误。下面的代码片段显示了我们将如何开始预处理这个例子的数据。 select_attributes = ['Weight','Height','Gender'] pre_process_df = pd.DataFrame(response_df[select_attributes]) pre_process_df.info() 运行前面的代码后，你可以看到，体重和身高有20个缺失值，性别有6个缺失值。假设我们知道这些缺失值是MCAR类型的。 为了处理回归分析的缺失值，我们不能使用保持原样的策略，因为我们计划使用的工具不能处理离群值。代入值也不是一个好的选择，因为这将在数据中产生偏差。因此，剩下的唯一可做的选择就是放弃数据对象。下面这行代码使用.dropna() 函数来删除缺失值的数据对象。 运行这段代码后，重新运行pre_process_df.info()以确认pre_process_df不再有缺失值。 现在我们确定pre_process_df中没有缺失值，我们可以把注意力转向检测和处理异常值，因为LR很容易出现异常值。我们需要检测数据是否有单变量、双变量或多变量的异常值。在下面的小节中，我们将一个步骤一个步骤地进行。 pre_process_df.dropna(inplace=True) pre_process_df.info() 检测单变量离群值并处理它们 下面的截图显示了在这个例子中为数字属性创建了图表，为分类属性创建了条形图的代码。 num_attributes = ['Weight','Height'] for i,att in enumerate(num_attributes): plt.subplot(1,3,i+1) pre_process_df[att].plot.box() plt.subplot(1,3,3) pre_process_df.Gender.value_counts().plot.bar() plt.tight_layout() plt.show() 在前面的截图中，我们可以看到，身高和体重都有离群值，但性别没有。因此，在继续进行LR分析之前，我们需要处理离群值。正如图11.25所建议的，我们可以使用以下两种方法之一来处理异常值。 - 删除这些数据对象 - 用它们的统计上限或下限取代它们 但哪种方法更好呢？当数据对象是单变量离群值时，最好使用第二种方法，因为替换统计上限或下限将有助于保留数据对象，同时减轻有离群值的数据对象的负面作用。 另一方面--这也普遍适用--当数据对象是双变量或多变量的离群值时，最好将其删除。这是因为这些离群值将不允许回归模型捕捉非离群值数据对象中的模式。 在双变量异常值的特殊情况下，即属性对是分类数字的，用特定人群的上限或下限替换异常值可能也是明智的。 因此，让我们首先处理单变量离群值，用统计学上的下限和上限替换它们。下面的代码将pre_process_df.Weight的离群值替换为该属性的统计上限。 Q3 = pre_process_df.Weight.quantile(0.75) Q1 = pre_process_df.Weight.quantile(0.25) IQR = Q3 - Q1 upper_cap = Q3+IQR*1.5 BM = pre_process_df.Weight > upper_cap pre_process_df.loc[pre_process_df[BM].index,'Weight'] = upper_cap 运行前面的代码后，运行pre_process_df.Weight.plot.box() ，看看离群值是否被处理了。另外，在继续替换pre_process_df.Height 中的flier之前，要注意两个事项，如下所示。 - 首先，通过观察图11.29，你会发现 pre_process_df.Weight 中的flier只比属性的统计上限值大。这就是为什么在前面的代码中，我们没有用属性的统计下限进行替换。当我们对pre_process_df.Height 做同样的程序时，这将会改变。 - 第二，我们可以让boxplot本身提取属性的统计上限和下限，但相反，我们分别使用公式 Q1-1.5*IQR 和Q3+1.5*IQR 来计算统计上限和下限。这是因为我们不想在自己有公式计算的情况下，让计算机不必要地画图而浪费计算资源。 pre_process_df.Weight.plot.box() 接下来，我们将对pre_process_df.Height 进行同样的程序，以处理单变量离群值。下面的代码显示了如何做到这一点。 在成功运行前面的代码后，运行pre_process_df.Weight.plot.box() 来检查离群值的状态。 现在，单变量的异常值已经被处理了，让我们看看是否有双变量或多变量的异常值。 Q3 = pre_process_df.Height.quantile(0.75) Q1 = pre_process_df.Height.quantile(0.25) IQR = Q3 - Q1 lower_cap = Q1-IQR*1.5 upper_cap = Q3+IQR*1.5 BM = pre_process_df.Height < lower_cap pre_process_df.loc[pre_process_df[BM].index,'Height'] = lower_cap BM = pre_process_df.Height > upper_cap pre_process_df.loc[pre_process_df[BM].index,'Height'] = upper_cap pre_process_df.Height.plot.box() 检测双变量离群值并处理它们 运行pre_process_df.plot.scatter(x='Height', y='Weight') 将显示我们没有基于高度和体重数字属性的双变量离群值。然而，运行下面的代码将告诉我们，我们在身高和性别以及体重和性别下确实有双变量离群值。 pre_process_df.plot.scatter(x='Height',y='Weight') plt.subplot(1,2,1) sns.boxplot(y=pre_process_df.Height,x=pre_process_df.Gender) plt.subplot(1,2,2) sns.boxplot(y=pre_process_df.Weight, x=pre_process_df.Gender) plt.tight_layout() 鉴于前面截图中公认的双变量离群值，我们将需要处理它们。由于这些离群值在分类-数字属性对中是双变量的，我们可能要用特定人群的上限或下限来替换它们。 下面的代码替换了高度-性别属性对的离群值。 for poss in pre_process_df.Gender.unique(): BM = pre_process_df.Gender == poss wdf = pre_process_df[BM] Q3 = wdf.Height.quantile(0.75) Q1 = wdf.Height.quantile(0.25) IQR = Q3 - Q1 lower_cap = Q1-IQR*1.5 upper_cap = Q3+IQR*1.5 BM = wdf.Height > upper_cap pre_process_df.loc[wdf[BM].index,'Height'] = upper_cap BM = wdf.Height < lower_cap pre_process_df.loc[wdf[BM].index,'Height'] = lower_cap 非常类似的代码将取代Weight-Gender属性对的离群值，如图所示。 for poss in pre_process_df.Gender.unique(): BM = pre_process_df.Gender == poss wdf = pre_process_df[BM] Q3 = wdf.Weight.quantile(0.75) Q1 = wdf.Weight.quantile(0.25) IQR = Q3 - Q1 lower_cap = Q1-IQR*1.5 upper_cap = Q3+IQR*1.5 BM = wdf.Weight > upper_cap pre_process_df.loc[wdf[BM].index,'Weight'] = upper_cap BM = wdf.Weight < lower_cap pre_process_df.loc[wdf[BM].index,'Weight'] = lower_cap 在成功运行前面的代码后，运行下面截图中的代码，也就是检测双变量异常值并处理它们下的代码，将显示我们已经处理了双变量异常值。 plt.subplot(1,2,1) sns.boxplot(y=pre_process_df.Height,x=pre_process_df.Gender) plt.subplot(1,2,2) sns.boxplot(y=pre_process_df.Weight, x=pre_process_df.Gender) plt.tight_layout() 检测多变量异常值并处理它们 为了检测多变量异常值，标准的方法是使用聚类分析；但是，当三个属性中有两个是数字属性，另一个是分类属性时，我们可以使用特定的可视化技术进行异常值检测。 下面的代码为性别分类属性的每种可能性创建了一个身高和体重的散点图。 cat_attribute_poss = pre_process_df.Gender.unique() for i,poss in enumerate(cat_attribute_poss): BM = pre_process_df.Gender == poss pre_process_df[BM].plot.scatter(x='Height',y='Weight') plt.title(poss) plt.show() 根据前面的截图，我们可以得出结论，数据中没有多变量的离群值。如果有的话，我们唯一的选择就是删除它们，因为离群值会对LR性能产生负面影响。另外，如前所述，对于多变量异常值来说，用大写字母和小写字母替换异常值是不可取的。 在处理了离群值和缺失值之后，我们终于准备好使用LR来估计身高、性别和体重之间的关系，以预测体重。 应用LR 在对pre_process_df应用LR之前，我们需要采取另一个预处理步骤。 请注意，Gender属性是分类的，不是数字的，而LR只能处理数字。因此，下面的代码将进行数据转换，使该属性成为二进制编码。 pre_process_df.Gender.replace({'male':0,'female':1},inplace=True) 下面的代码分别在data_X和data_Y中准备好独立和依赖属性，然后使用sklearn中的LinearRegression() 。 linear_model来将预处理的数据拟合到模型中。 from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression X = ['Height','Gender'] y = 'Weight' data_X = pre_process_df[X] data_y = pre_process_df[y] lm = LinearRegression() lm.fit(data_X, data_y) 如果前面的代码运行成功，那么我们可以运行下面截图中的代码，从拟合的lm值中获取估计的β值。 print('intercept (b0) ', lm.intercept_) coef_names = ['b1','b2'] print(pd.DataFrame({'Predictor': data_X.columns, 'coefficient Name':coef_names, 'coefficient Value': lm.coef_})) 因此，可以从前面的截图中的输出驱动以下方程。该方程现在可以根据个人的身高和性别值来预测个人的体重值。 例如，我的身高是189厘米，性别是男性（0）。使用以下公式，我的体重可以预测为82.895。 这很好，但是我现在的体重是86公斤，所以有4公斤左右的误差。 2.2.9 例子4 在这个例子中，我们想重复之前的例子，但这次我们想用多层感知器（MLP）来预测基于性别和身高的体重。 这个例子与上一个例子的数据预处理不同之处在于，MLP对异常值有弹性，我们不需要担心数据集有异常值。 然而，我们确实需要处理缺失值和性别属性的二进制代码。下面的代码重新创建了pre_process_df，处理了缺失值，并对性别属性进行了二进制编码转换。 select_attributes = ['Weight','Height','Gender'] pre_process_df = pd.DataFrame(response_df[select_attributes]) pre_process_df.dropna(inplace=True) pre_process_df.Gender.replace({'male':0,'female':1},inplace=True) 运行前面的代码后，pre_process_df 已经准备好用于MLP。 下面的代码分别在data_X和data_Y中准备好独立和依赖属性，然后使用sklearn.linear_model 中的MLPRegressor() 将预处理过的数据拟合到模型中。 from sklearn.neural_network import MLPRegressor X = ['Height','Gender'] y = 'Weight' data_X = pre_process_df[X] data_y = pre_process_df[y] mlp = MLPRegressor(hidden_layer_sizes=5, max_iter=3000) mlp.fit(data_X, data_y) 一旦前面的代码运行成功，我们就可以使用训练好的mlp属性来进行预测。下面的代码片段显示了如何使用mlp根据我的身高和性别值来提取我的体重值的预测。 newData = pd.DataFrame({'Height':189.5,'Gender':0}, index=[0]) mlp.predict(newData) # array([79.89579149]) 在我最后一次运行前面的代码时，我得到的预测结果是80.0890。你会记得，MLP是一个随机变量，每次运行它，我们都会期待一个新的结果。总之，由于我的体重是86，MLP大约是6公斤。这是否意味着与MLP相比，lm（之前的例子）是一个预测器？不一定--毕竟，我只是一个数据点。需要更多的测试数据来做这个判断。 让我们看看另一个例子，其特点是为了应用聚类分析而处理异常值，然后再继续下一个项目。 2.2.10 例子5 在这个例子中，我们想使用chicago_population.csv 。这个数据集中的数据对象是芝加哥的社区。这些数据对象由以下属性描述。 - 人口。社区的人口 - 收入。社区的收入中位数 - 拉美人：拉美人在人口中的百分比 - 黑人。黑人：黑人在人口中的百分比 - 白人。白人在人口中的百分比 - 亚洲人：亚洲人在人口中的百分比 - 其他。其他种族在人口中的百分比 芝加哥市长希望为这77个社区指派5名沟通联络员。办公室的数据分析员建议采用K-Means聚类法，将社区分成五组，并根据聚类组的特点分配适当的联络员。 首先，我们将把文件读入community_df pandas DataFrame ，并检查数据集中是否有缺失值。下面的代码显示了如何做到这一点。 community_df = pd.read_csv('chicago_population.csv') community_df.info() 阅读前面代码的输出，我们会发现community_df 中没有缺失值。接下来，我们需要检测异常值并加以处理。 检测单变量离群值并处理它们 下面的代码使用sns.boxplot() 来创建所有数字属性的boxplots。 numerical_atts = ['population', 'income', 'latino', 'black', 'white', 'asian','other'] plt.figure(figsize=(12,3)) for i,att in enumerate(numerical_atts): plt.subplot(1,len(numerical_atts),i+1) sns.boxplot(y=community_df[att]) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() 在前面的截图中，我们可以看到我们在人口、亚洲和其他属性方面有一些单变量的离群值。 由于我们正在使用K-Means 将社区聚类为五个同质组来分配沟通联络人，处理离群值的最好方法是用统计学上的小写或大写来代替它们。我们不希望离群值的极端值影响聚类的结果。 请注意，在应用聚类分析之前，这并不是处理异常值的唯一或最佳方法。如果我们使用聚类分析来找出数据中的固有模式，那么处理异常值的最好方法就是什么都不做。 下面的代码使用了与我们在例3下使用的类似的代码来过滤异常值，然后用适当的上限来替换它们。请注意，这段代码比我们在例3中看到的要聪明一些，因为处理离群值的过程在一个循环中被参数化了。 pre_process_df = community_df.set_index('name') candidate_atts = ['population','asian','other'] for att in candidate_atts: Q3 = pre_process_df[att].quantile(0.75) Q1 = pre_process_df[att].quantile(0.25) IQR = Q3 - Q1 lower_cap = Q1-IQR*1.5 upper_cap = Q3+IQR*1.5 BM = pre_process_df[att] < lower_cap candidate_index = pre_process_df[BM].index pre_process_df.loc[candidate_index,att] = lower_cap BM = pre_process_df[att] > upper_cap candidate_index = pre_process_df[BM].index pre_process_df.loc[candidate_index,att] = upper_cap 运行前面的代码后，单变量离群值将被替换成适当的统计上限。 numerical_atts = ['population', 'income', 'latino', 'black', 'white', 'asian','other'] plt.figure(figsize=(12,3)) for i,att in enumerate(numerical_atts): plt.subplot(1,len(numerical_atts),i+1) sns.boxplot(y=pre_process_df[att]) plt.tight_layout() plt.show() 检测双变量和多变量的异常值并处理它们 它对检测双变量和多变量异常值没有任何价值，因为在这个阶段，我们对它们的唯一策略是什么都不做--我们不能用大写或小写来代替它们，因为有不止一个数字属性；我们也不能删除数据对象，因为我们需要所有数据对象至少在一个聚类中。因此，pre_process_df 的当前状态是聚类分析的最佳状态。 由于数据预处理已经完成，这个例子中唯一剩下的步骤就是进行聚类。这就是我们接下来要做的事情。 应用K-Means 下面的代码片段显示了第八章聚类分析中K-Means聚类的调整版代码。 from sklearn.cluster import KMeans dimensions = ['population', 'income', 'latino', 'black', 'white', 'asian','other'] Xs = pre_process_df[dimensions] Xs = (Xs - Xs.min())/(Xs.max()-Xs.min()) kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5) kmeans.fit(Xs) 一旦前面的代码运行成功，集群就会形成。下面的截图显示了我们可以用来提取集群的代码和代码的输出。 for i in range(5): BM = kmeans.labels_==i print('Cluster {}: {}'.format(i,pre_process_df[BM].index.values)) 我们还可以对刚刚形成的聚类进行中心点分析。中心点分析的代码在第8章聚类分析中的使用K-Means对超过两个维度的数据集进行聚类一节中介绍过。找到这段代码并调整它，以确认以下热图是中心点分析的结果。请注意，由于K-Means是一种随机算法，我们确实期望热图会有所不同。同时，我们期望从数据中出现的模式是相似的。 clusters = ['Cluster {}'.format(i) for i in range(5)] Centroids = pd.DataFrame(0.0, index = clusters, columns = Xs.columns) for i,clst in enumerate(clusters): BM = kmeans.labels_==i Centroids.loc[clst] = Xs[BM].median(axis=0) sns.heatmap(Centroids, linewidths=.5, annot=True, cmap='binary') plt.show() 我们可以从前面的截图中看到，每个群组中的社区都有明显的不同，这个结果对分配交流联络人有极大的帮助。 本章到目前为止，我们已经介绍了如何检测和处理缺失值和异常值的例子。接下来，我们将把注意力转向检测数据集中的错误并处理它们。 3 错误值 误差是任何数据收集和测量中不可避免的一部分。下面的公式最能体现这一事实。 真正的信号是我们试图测量并以数据的形式呈现的现实，但由于我们的测量系统或数据表现的无能，我们无法捕获真正的信号。因此，误差是真实信号和记录数据之间的差异。 例如，假设我们购买了七个温度计，我们想用这七个温度计准确地计算出室温。在某个特定的时间点，我们从它们身上取得以下读数。 看看前面的截图，你会说房间的温度--真实信号--是多少？答案是，我们无法测量或捕获真实信号--在这种情况下，房间的确切温度。有了七个温度计，我们也许能得出更准确的读数，但我们无法消除误差。 3.1 错误类型 有两种类型的错误：随机错误（random errors）和系统错误（systematic errors）。这两类误差的最大区别是，随机误差是不可避免的，但系统误差是可以避免的。 随机误差的发生是由于不可避免的不一致和我们测量设备的限制。我们在七个温度计的例子中看到的就是一个随机误差的案例。另一个例子是在使用调查表测量人们的意见时，由于不可避免的沟通不畅和误解而发生的随机误差。 另一方面，系统性错误是由于在整个数据收集过程中持续存在的问题而发生的可避免的不一致。系统性错误发生在随机错误之上，也就是说，随机错误总是存在的。例如，如果使用未经校准的温度计来测量室温，由于设备无法捕捉到真实的信号，我们有随机误差，同时由于在测量行为之前没有校准温度计，我们也有系统误差。 3.2 处理错误 我们将根据错误的类型，以不同的方式处理它们。随机误差是不可避免的，在最好的情况下，我们可能会使用平滑或聚合的方式来减轻它们。这些都是我们将在未来的某一章中介绍的技术。数据处理和转换。 然而，系统性错误是可以避免的，一旦认识到这一点，我们应该始终采取以下步骤来处理它们。 - 调整和改进数据收集，使系统性错误在未来不会发生。 - 如果有的话，尝试使用其他数据资源来寻找正确的数值，如果没有的话，我们将把系统性错误视为缺失的数值。 从第二步开始，你将把系统性错误作为缺失值来处理。 这很好，因为我们已经涵盖了数值，并且在处理缺失值方面得到了许多强大的工具和技术。 3.3 检测系统性错误 检测系统性错误不是很容易，很可能它们没有被注意到，并对我们的分析产生负面影响。我们检测系统性错误的最好机会是我们在检测异常值部分学到的技术。当检测到离群值，并且没有解释为什么离群值是正确的，那么我们可以得出结论，离群值是系统性错误。下面的例子将有助于阐明这一区别。 系统误差和纠正异常值的例子 在这个例子中，我们想分析CustomerEntries.xlsx 。这个数据集包含了从2020年10月1日到2020年11月24日之间一家当地咖啡店的大约2个月的顾客访问数据。分析的目的是对一天中的各个时段进行剖析，以了解客户访问高峰发生在哪些时间和日期。 下面的截图显示了将文件读入hour_df pandas DataFrame 的代码，以及使用.info()函数来评估数据集的缺失值状态。 hour_df = pd.read_excel('CustomerEnteries.xlsx') hour_df.info() 我们可以从前面的截图中看到，数据集没有缺失值。接下来，我们将把注意力转向检查离群值。由于数据集本质上是一个时间序列，最好使用线图来查看是否有任何异常值。下面的截图显示了运行hour_df.N_Customers.plot() 创建线图的输出。 hour_df.N_Customers.plot() plt.show() 在前面的截图中，我们可以看到我们有一个明显的离群点的情况，在200和300索引之间。运行hour_df[hour_df.N_Customers>20] 会发现，离群点发生在索引232，其时间戳为2020-10-26的16。 hour_df[hour_df.N_Customers>20] 为了检查这个离群点是否是一个系统性错误的案例，我们使用其他来源进行调查，我们意识到在那一天没有发生任何异常情况，这个记录可能只是一个人工数据输入错误。这表明这是一个系统性错误，因此我们需要采取以下两个步骤来处理系统性错误。 - 第一步：我们将这个错误告知负责数据收集的实体，并要求他们采取适当的措施来防止今后发生这样的错误。 - 步骤2：如果我们没有办法在合理的时间和精力内利用其他资源找到正确的值，我们就把这个数据条目视为缺失值，并用 np.nan 来代替它。下面的代码可以解决这个问题。 err_index = hour_df[hour_df.N_Customers>20].index hour_df.at[err_index,'N_Customers']=np.nan hour_df.N_Customers.plot() plt.show() 你可以在前面的截图中看到，我们不再看到单变量的离群点了。 虽然这个时间序列看起来像一个单变量数据集，但它并不是单变量的，我们可以随时进行二级数据清洗来解开新的列，如月、日、工作日、小时和分钟。在这个数据集中，时间和数据已经被分离，所以我们可以进行下面的双变量离群检测。 正如你所记得的，对一对数字分类属性进行双变量离群点检测的最好方法是使用多个boxplots。下面的截图显示了sns.boxplot(y=hour_df.N_Customers, x=hour_df.Time) 的输出，这是我们需要的多个boxplots，以查看N_Customers和Time属性是否存在双变量离群值。 sns.boxplot(y=hour_df.N_Customers,x=hour_df.Time) plt.show() 看看前面的截图，我们确实看到我们还有两个可能是系统性错误的离群值。第一个是N_Customers的最小值，它是零，在时间值17之下。该值与数据的其他部分一致。时间值17（或下午5点）似乎得到的顾客数量最少，我们可以想象在这个时间段偶尔没有顾客。 然而，在同一时间（下午5点）的第二个传单似乎更令人不安。运行hour_df.query(\"Time==17 and N_Customers>12\") ，对传单进行过滤后，我们可以看到异常点已经发生在2020年11月17日。经过调查，原来在2020年11月17日4:25，一个自行车俱乐部在半小时内停下来吃点心，这对该店来说是不正常的。因此，这个数据输入并没有错误，只是一个正确的离群值。 hour_df.query(\"Time==17 and N_Customers>12\") 对hour_df进行预处理后，它现在有一个缺失值（用np.nan替换的系统误差）和两个双变量离群值。了解到这一点，我们允许自己进入最后一步：分析。 绘制一个条形图来显示和比较咖啡店每个工作小时的N_Customers（时间）的中心趋势，将是我们在这个分析中需要的可视化。 按规定的条形图可以很容易地处理缺失值，因为要计算中心趋势的数据汇总。由于我们在数据集中有异常值，我们选择使用中位数而不是平均值作为本次分析的中心趋势。运行下面这行代码将创建所述的条形图。 hour_df.groupby('Time').N_Customers.median().plot.bar() plt.show() 正如你在这个例子中所经历的，我们用来检测和处理系统性错误的技术已经在缺失值和异常值的小节中有所涉及。简而言之，当我们找不到任何支持来相信一个离群值是一个正确的值时，我们就把它看作是一个系统性错误，因而也是一个缺失值。 4 总结 祝贺你在本章的学习。这一章涵盖了数据清理的第三级。我们一起学习了如何检测和处理缺失值、离群值和错误。对于这么长的一章来说，这听起来似乎是一个太短的总结，但正如我们所看到的，检测、诊断和处理这三个问题（缺失值、异常值和错误）中的每一个都会有很多细节和妙处。完成这一章是一个重要的成就，现在你知道如何检测、诊断和处理在处理数据集时可能遇到的所有这三个问题。 本章结束了我们长达三章的数据清洗之旅。在下一章，我们将进入另一个重要的数据预处理领域，那就是数据融合和整合。在进入下一章之前，请花一些时间做以下练习，以巩固你的学习成果。",

              "content": "无论考虑得多么周全，每项研究工作都会遇到挑战。我们根本无法预测整个过程中所有可能出现的变数。 这些未知的界限和突如其来的限制被称为研究的局限性。找到并承认局限性对于严谨的开展研究至关重要。局限性提供了研究的背景，并揭示了当前研究和文献中存在的差距。 本文将探讨研究局限性的重要性，并分享如何有效地撰写研究局限性的方法。通过解读研究中的局限性并例举一些典型案例，我们旨在重塑人们的认识，从可耻的错误转变为值得尊敬的启示。 什么是研究局限性？ 最简单明了的说法是，研究局限性是指研究中存在的实验或理论缺陷，这些缺陷往往不在研究人员的控制范围之内。虽然这些缺陷限制了研究结论的推广应用，但也为今后的研究奠定了基础。 有时，局限是由具体情况造成的，如时间和资金的限制，或设备和参与者的可用性。而有时，其原因则更为隐晦，隐藏在研究设计中。常见的局限性类型及其影响包括 - 理论局限：局限于研究的范围、深度或适用性。 - 方法论：数据的质量、数量或多样性的局限。 - 经验性：数据代表性、有效性或可靠性的局限。 - 分析性：研究结果的准确性、完整性或重要性的局限。 - 伦理性：数据的获取、同意或保密的局限。 无论局限是如何、何时或为何产生的，它们都是研究过程的自然组成部分，绝不应被忽视。与所有其他方面一样，它们本身的目的也至关重要。 为什么承认研究局限性很重要？ 无论是为了寻求认同还是避免纷争，人类往往会本能地隐藏缺点和错误。然而，将这种想法与研究结合起来，试图掩盖局限性，则是一个坏主意。它有可能否定科研成果的有效性，损害学者的声誉。 通过在整个研究课题中发现并解决局限性问题，研究人员可以加强他们的论据，减少因忽略错误而受到同行指责的机会。指出这些缺陷表明研究人员了解变量的局限性，并在研究过程中保持严谨的态度。 对研究课题的界限和挑战有所认识并肩负起责任，是对研究人员诚信和透明度的肯定。它进一步表明研究人员了解适用的文献，并对其选择的研究方法进行了全面评估。 说明局限性还能为读者提供研究结果的来龙去脉，从而使读者受益。它引导读者仅在非常具体的条件范围内解释研究结论。通过允许对研究结果进行适当的概括，使其准确地限制在研究范围内，而不是过于宽泛，从而提高研究的可信度。 局限是研究过程中的真正财富。它们凸显了未来研究的机遇。当研究人员确定了他们处理研究问题的特定方法的局限性时，就能实现精确的可迁移性（transferability），并提高可重复实验的几率。 不过，仅仅说明课题的局限性还不足以促进进一步的研究。为了激发其他研究人员的兴趣，这些承认的局限性必须附带详尽的解释，说明这些局限性如何影响当前的研究，以及如何通过修改研究方法来克服这些局限性。 如何撰写研究局限性 通常情况下，有关研究局限性的信息要么放在讨论部分的开头，为读者提供背景信息，要么放在讨论部分的结尾，以说明进一步研究的必要性。不过，这取决于目标期刊或出版指南。 不要掩盖你的研究局限性 同样重要的是，不要在论文正文中隐藏研究局限性，除非它与该部分的主题有独特的联系。如果是这样，就需要与其他限制条件一起重申，或者在讨论部分的结尾处重申。无论将研究局限写入稿件何处，都应确保局限性部分位于显著位置并清晰介绍。 虽然通过披露局限性来保持透明度意味着需要采取一种全面的方法，但没有必要讨论研究过程中可能出现的所有问题。如果在引言中没有说对此进行了研究，那就没有必要将该问题视为研究的局限性。完全考虑 \"limitations \"一词，并问问自己 “它是否极大地改变或限制了可能的研究结果”然后，将发生的情况限定为限制因素，纳入当前手稿或作为其他课题的注意事项。 撰写研究局限性 一旦确定了限制因素，并决定将其写入论文的哪个部分，研究人员就可以开写了。只包含相关内容、保持详细而简洁的解释并采用以下的指导原则是撰写有价值的限制条件的关键： 1) 确定并描述局限： 通过对局限的形式进行分类并说明其来源，清晰地介绍局限性。例如 - 数据收集过程中遇到的无意偏差 - 有意使用计划外的事后数据分析（post-hoc data analysis） 2) 解释影响： 说明限制因素如何潜在地影响研究结果，以及随后如何影响研究的有效性和可推广性。举例说明并提供证据支持限制因素的影响，不要找借口或夸大其影响。总之，在介绍局限性时要透明、客观，不要削弱研究的重要性。 3) 为今后的研究提供替代方法： 就可能的改进或进一步研究的途径提出具体建议。通过鼓励未来的研究来弥补已发现的差距，从而扩大知识基础，以显示积极主动的态度。 无论是将局限性作为稿件中的一个单独章节，还是作为讨论部分的一个子主题，作者都应使用清晰的标题和直白的语言，以提高可读性。没有必要用专业术语、计算或复杂的数据集将局限性复杂化。 常见研究局限性举例 研究局限性一般分为两类：方法和研究过程。 方法局限 研究方法可能包括以下局限性： - 样本量 - 缺乏可用或可靠的数据 - 缺乏有关该领域的先前研究 - 用于收集数据的方法 - 自我报告的数据（Self-reported data） The researcher is addressing how the large sample size requires a reassessment of the measures used to collect and analyze the data. 研究过程中的局限性 研究过程中的局限可能来自以下方面： - 获取信息 - 纵向效应（Longitudinal effects） - 文化和其他偏见 - 语言流畅性 - 时间限制 The author is pointing out that the model’s estimates are based on potentially biased observational studies. 最后 成功证明理论和吹嘘伟大成就只是学术研究的两个非常狭隘的目标。研究人员真正的热情和最大的努力更多来自于对假设的质疑和对未知事物的探索。 从很多方面来说，认识并分享研究的局限性既承认也鼓励这种不断推动研究向前发展的发现。通过利用这些局限清楚说明研究的界限，并将研究结果与背景相结合，研究人员为今后开展更坚实、更有影响力的研究铺平了道路。",

              "content": "摘要 睡眠呼吸障碍领域近一年来取得了显著进展，本文回顾了2022年10月1日至2023年9月30日的研究成果，着重探讨了阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（OSA）的异质性、诊断和评估方法及个体化治疗等关键问题，这些研究为OSA的临床管理和未来研究方向提供有益信息。 睡眠呼吸障碍（sleep disordered breathing，SDB）是一组广泛流行的疾病，其特征是在睡眠期间出现异常的呼吸模式。阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（obstructive sleep apnea，OSA）是其最常见的类型，OSA引发的夜间间歇性低氧和睡眠片段化通过多种机制导致全身多系统受损，给全球带来巨大的健康和经济负担。近年来，随着对OSA的疾病异质性、严重程度评估以及个体化精准治疗的日益关注，这一领域不断取得进展。本文拟围绕2022年10月1日至2023年9月30日期间SDB领域的重要研究进展进行综述。 一、OSA的异质性 OSA具有多样的病理生理机制（内型）和临床特征（表型），因此在诊断和治疗OSA时需考虑其异质性［1］。OSA内型特征的识别有助于选择合适的靶向干预治疗［2］，而表型分析和亚组识别有助于进一步理解OSA临床症状、内型特征和预后之间的关联，为个体化治疗提供信息。 1. OSA内型特征：近期的研究集中于使用自动化程序分析多导睡眠监测（polysomnography，PSG）以量化OSA的生理内型特征，如临界闭合压异常、低觉醒阈值、高环路增益和上气道扩张肌反应性。尽管这些方法有望减少传统内型测定方法的临床可及性限制，但PSG内型分析的稳定性和可重复性仍然需要更多研究。Tolbert等［3］对43例患者进行了连续两晚的PSG内型分析，个体间比较结果支持通过PSG内型对OSA患者进行分组和聚类；然而，纵向对比结果显示，在同一患者连续两晚的重复测量中存在个体内变异性。这表明在从“表型识别”转向“治疗指导”的过程中，仍存在一些知识空白有待进一步研究［4］。Strassberger等［5］报告了PSG内型分析结果在4周内具有良好的稳定性，并首次定义了最小可检测差异（minimal detectable differences，MDDs），该值可用于量化非自发性变异的最小变化阈值，为内型特征分类的临床应用提供了重要的参考依据。 2. OSA表型分析：OSA的表型分析和亚组识别有助于揭示不同临床表型之间的差异。国内一项研究采用20种临床症状和呼吸事件相关的低氧指标对OSA患者进行聚类分析，从而鉴别出不同的潜在临床表型［6］。这些不同的表型表现出不同的症状和预后，对于临床管理具有重要意义。另一项研究则通过亚组分析显示，不同的内型特征与临床表型存在关联。例如，高气道塌陷性或高环路增益组与肥胖、困倦以及更严重的夜间低氧血症相关，而低觉醒阈值组则表现出睡眠紊乱和睡眠片段［7］。此外，OSA合并失眠症（COMISA）作为OSA的常见临床表型，通常具备低觉醒阈值这一内型特征，这提示治疗失眠（增加觉醒阈值）可能对COMISA患者有效［8］。 二、OSA的诊断和评估 呼吸暂停低通气指数（apnea-hypopnea index，AHI）和氧减指数（oxygen desaturation index，ODI）等传统频率指标在评估OSA严重程度时未能反映其亚组异质性，在预测OSA不良并发症方面存在局限性。因此，近年来，国内外学者积极探索新的标志物，以更准确地界定OSA的严重程度，从而为评估OSA患者的并发症风险和指导个体化治疗提供新的依据。 （一）PSG衍生指标 PSG作为OSA的诊断金标准，提供了丰富的生理信息和广泛的临床可及性。PSG数据可用于衍生一系列新指标，包括低氧和生物电活动相关指标，有助于更全面地评估OSA。 1. 低氧相关指标：低氧负荷（hypoxic burden，HB）能够量化呼吸事件相关的氧减程度和持续时间，并被证明能有效反映OSA患者的通气负荷［9］。该指标与全因死亡率、心血管疾病死亡率、心力衰竭、高血压、慢性肾脏病等风险有关，为临床管理提供重要指导。最近，基于单一血氧信号衍生的低氧负荷指标（oximetry-derived hypoxic burden，HBOxi）简化了呼吸事件分析过程，但仍能够提供类似HB的评估效果［10］。睡眠呼吸受损指数（sleep breathing impairment index，SBII）则综合考虑呼吸事件的频率和持续时间以及相关的氧饱和度下降，是对OSA更详细的量化［11］。研究表明，SBII与OSA患者的心血管风险增加［6，11］，以及COMISA患者的糖尿病患病率［12］独立相关。此外，平均呼吸事件持续时间较短与全因死亡风险增加［13］及2型糖尿病患病率［14］相关，表明平均呼吸事件持续时间可能是诊断OSA合并症的独立指标。 2. 脉搏相关指标：脉搏波振幅下降（pulse wave amplitude drop，PWAD）指数定义为每小时脉搏波振幅下降>30%的次数，可通过脉搏血氧仪经光电容积描记法（photoplethysmography，PPG）计算获得，被认为能够反映自主神经和血管反应性。在OSA患者中，低PWAD指数与心血管风险较高独立相关，是OSA心血管风险的生物标志物［15］。此外，脉率升高与OSA患者的呼吸事件相关觉醒独立相关，可能作为觉醒的替代指标［16］。 3. 脑电相关指标：通过睡眠脑电信号记录的阵发性慢波事件（paroxysmal slow wave events，PSWE）频率增加［17］以及非快速动眼2期纺锤波密度减低［18］与OSA患者的认知功能障碍相关，是评估OSA认知合并症的生物标志物。 （二）机器学习模型 人工智能的发展为传统OSA诊断和评估提供了补充策略，特别是基于单一血氧通道的分析算法有望推动便携式诊断模式的发展。Levy等［19］基于单通道脉搏血氧饱和度数据开发了一种深度学习算法（OxiNet），能够稳定地预测OSA患者的呼吸暂停低通气指数。Huttunen等［20］构建了基于PPG的深度学习模型，无需监测脑电信号即可实现自动化睡眠分期和呼吸事件评分。机器学习技术为实现OSA的准确预测、大规模诊断和持续监控提供了潜在应用前景。 （三）新型监测设备 新兴的睡眠监测技术，包括可穿戴和非可穿戴设备，可持续记录用户睡眠期间的呼吸、心电信号、下颌肌电等信息，显示出评估OSA的潜在价值［21］。例如，新型下颌传感器（Sunrise系统）可测量睡眠期间异常的呼吸努力，最新研究显示其预测OSA患者高血压患病率的优势［22］。虽然这些新设备仍存在一些局限性，如噪声、缺乏脑电监测数据和临床验证，但有望为OSA患者提供长期的纵向监测。 三、OSA个体化治疗 OSA的机制多样性与目前相对单一的临床治疗方法之间的不匹配问题备受关注。有症状的OSA患者通常接受持续气道正压通气（continuous positive airway pressure，CPAP）治疗，或者进行生活方式调整（如减重），但这些方法缺乏个体化选择策略，且依从性差。近一年来，OSA的个体化治疗研究取得显著进展，尤其是在药物治疗方面取得了积极的结果。 （一）药物治疗 OSA的亚型研究为OSA治疗提供了潜在的药物干预目标，并已在临床试验阶段取得了多个有潜在治疗效果的候选药物。目前基于OSA内型特性总结的四个关键药物治疗靶点，分别是上气道扩张肌功能、上气道扩张肌反应性、化学敏感性和通气控制，以及觉醒阈值［23］。 1. 上气道扩张肌功能：以颏舌肌为主的咽部扩张肌在防止睡眠期间气道塌陷方面起关键作用。多项临床试验证明，去甲肾上腺素再摄取抑制剂（如托莫西汀或瑞波西汀）和抗毒蕈碱药物（如奥昔布宁或非索罗定）的联合使用可以协同增加睡眠期间咽部扩张肌活动，从而降低OSA的严重程度［24, 25］。近期一项随机对照研究表明，OSA患者通常对为期4周的托莫西汀和奥昔布宁联合治疗耐受性良好，联合用药组的低氧负荷较基线降低约50%［26］。Schweitzer等［27］一项更大规模的临床试验（n=211）结果表明，托莫西汀联合新型抗毒蕈碱药物Aroxybutynin有效改善了OSA患者的主观疲劳症状和客观严重程度指标。临床研究报告的不良事件主要是口干、失眠和尿潴留，但潜在的药物副作用（如觉醒阈值降低、心血管活动增加）对OSA患者的影响仍需进一步评估。 2. 上气道扩张肌反应性：吸气时气道内压力变化通过感觉传入神经刺激上气道扩张肌的反射性激活，有助于维持上气道稳定性。Osman等［28］通过动物实验证明，经鼻局部应用新型钾离子（TASK）通道拮抗剂（BAY2586116）能够增加咽部机械刺激感受器的敏感性，使得颏舌肌的激活阈值降低。临床研究进一步表明局部应用BAY2586116可改善OSA患者的气道塌陷情况［28］。 3. 化学敏感性和通气控制：环路增益用于量化呼吸控制系统负反馈回路的灵敏度，高环路增益可导致低碳酸血症并抑制上气道呼吸驱动力，从而加重OSA。研究表明新型碳酸酐酶抑制剂舒噻嗪能够通过降低环路增益来改善OSA严重程度［29］。 4. 觉醒阈值：睡眠中觉醒可通过诱发过度通气进一步加重通气控制的不稳定。对于低唤醒阈值的OSA患者，使用镇静催眠药物（如佐匹克隆和曲唑酮）可以提高觉醒阈值，允许化学呼吸驱动的积累，从而促进通气稳定。研究表明，曲唑酮和托莫西汀的联合应用不仅显著改善了OSA患者病情的严重程度，同时还有效减小了单独使用托莫西汀治疗引起患者觉醒阈值下降的不良效应［30］。 （二）CPAP治疗 CPAP的治疗效果与OSA内型以及患者依从性有关。Cheng等［31］的研究表明，具备高气道塌陷性、高环路增益的OSA患者在接受CPAP治疗1个月后睡眠结构的改善更加显著。新近荟萃分析指出，坚持CPAP治疗（平均使用时间≥4小时/天）与OSA患者心脑血管事件风险降低相关，是OSA患者心血管疾病的一、二级预防的关键因素，强调提高患者依从性对于改善临床结局的重要性［32］。此外，OSA的严重程度、以日间嗜睡为主的症状、患者体重指数变化、早期CPAP治疗的依从性，均可能是影响OSA患者长期坚持CPAP治疗的潜在因素［32］。因此，为提高CPAP疗效，应优先考虑实施具体、个性化的干预措施增加患者依从性。 （三）其他治疗 新型眼罩睡眠体位治疗（Sleep Position Therapy，SPT）设备内置体位传感器、鼾声传感器和振动元件，结合血氧监测装置，能够连续记录患者睡眠期间的体位、鼾声强度和氧饱和度，并在超过设定阈值时通过低频振动提示患者改变体位［33］。研究结果显示，联合使用眼罩SPT和口腔矫治器可显著改善体位性OSA患者的AHI和低氧负荷［33］。Wong等［34］的前瞻性研究表明，上气道手术能够改善OSA患者的上气道塌陷性，但对其他非解剖内型无显著效果。 （四）OSA管理模式 开展以患者为中心的诊疗是一种切实可行的个体化疾病管理模式。罗金梅和肖毅［35］强调了鼓励患者和家属共同参与OSA的治疗决策，从而提高患者依从性的重要作用。此外，基于“云加端”平台的远程医疗技术有望优化OSA诊疗的连续性和可及性，为实现对OSA患者的长期有效管理以及构建元宇宙OSA医疗模式奠定基础［36］。 四、其他SDB疾病研究进展 肥胖低通气综合征（obesity hypoventilation syndrome，OHS）与OSA密切相关，大多数OHS患者合并OSA。与单纯OSA相比，OHS患者通常表现出更为显著的嗜睡、夜间低氧、日间高碳酸血症以及更高的心肺疾病风险［37］。研究结果表明，年龄较大的女性具有更高的OHS患病风险，即使肥胖程度较轻并且对治疗更为依从，但更易伴有持续性高碳酸血症［38, 39］。然而，目前对OHS的治疗主要集中在体重管理和无创通气（non-invasive ventilation，NIV）［40］，尚无有效的药物治疗。鉴于瘦素缺乏或瘦素抵抗与OHS的病理机制相关，重组人瘦素衍生物美曲普汀（Metreleptin）或瘦素受体激动剂有望成为治疗OHS的潜在药物［41, 42］。此外，生酮饮食可能在调控OHS患者高碳酸血症和睡眠期呼吸障碍方面发挥积极作用［43］，可作为一种饮食干预方法以改善OHS病情。 五、展望 OSA精准医疗的时代已然到来，强调应根据患者独特的内型、表型特征以及相关合并症来制定个性化治疗方案。新的OSA量化指标和监测设备为诊断和评估OSA提供了新方法，同时也有助于探索和管理疾病相关的靶器官损害。新药研究为不同亚型的OSA患者提供了相宜的治疗选择。未来的研究应引领新一代的监测技术与量化指标的整合，以实现OSA的更准确、更全面的诊断和评估，为治疗决策提供更为可靠的依据；应推进新药研究进程，促进从理论、试验到临床应用的转化，实现精准医疗在OSA治疗中的深度应用。同时，未来应着眼于构建综合性的OSA管理策略，包括亚型识别、共病防治、慢病管理等，以提高OSA患者整体健康水平，实现更为有效和可持续的健康管理。 参考文献（略） 作者：惠馨颉 肖毅；单位：中国医学科学院 北京协和医学院 北京协和医院呼吸与危重症医学科 引用本文: 惠馨颉, 肖毅. 睡眠呼吸障碍年度进展2023 [J] . 中华结核和呼吸杂志, 2024, 47(1) : 59-63.

              "content": "Abstract Sleep is a highly conserved phenomenon in endotherms, and has a universal physiological function across all species. In mammals, sleep can be divided into two stages: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep, which alternate in a cyclic manner. Humans spend about one-third of their lives asleep. Sufficient sleep is necessary for humans to sustain everyday functioning. Sleep plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism, immune defense, endocrine function, and the consolidation of memory process. With the development of social economy and the change of life style, sleep duration of the residents has gradually decreased and the incidence of sleep disturbances has increased. Sleep disturbances can lead to severe mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, dementia, and other mental diseases, and may increase the risk of physical diseases, such as chronic inflammation, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis and others. Maintaining good sleep is of great significance for developing social productive forces, promoting sustainable development of economic society, and is a necessary condition for carrying out the \"Healthy China Strategy\". The sleep research in China started in 1950s. After decades of development, researchers have made great progress in the molecular mechanisms of sleep and wakefulness, the pathogenesis of sleep disorders and the development of new therapies. With the advancement of science and technology and the public's attention to sleep, the level of clinical diagnosis and therapy of sleep disorders in China is gradually brought in line with international standards. The publication of diagnosis and treatment guidelines in the field of sleep medicine will promote the standardization of the construction. In the future, it is still necessary to promote the development of sleep medicine in the following aspects: Strengthening the professional training and discipline construction, improving the cooperation of sleep research, promoting the intelligent diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, and developing the new intervention strategies. Therefore, this review will comprehensively summarize the origin, current situation, and future expectations of sleep medicine in China, including discipline construction of sleep medicine, the number of sleep project grants, research findings, the status and progress of diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders, and the development direction of sleep medicine. Keywords: Sleep medicine, Sleep disorders, China, Research progress 睡眠是生物进化过程中最基本的生命过程，占据人生约三分之一的时间，是人类生活最重要的组成部分[1]。人类睡眠主要分为快速眼动(rapid eye movement，REM)睡眠和非快速眼动(non-rapid eye movement，NREM)睡眠，以大约90~100 min为一个周期出现NREM睡眠到REM睡眠的交替循环[2]。睡眠对机体能量代谢、免疫调节、内分泌及脑功能活动等生理机能发挥重要调控作用，良好的睡眠有助于促进体力和精力恢复、提高记忆力和增强抵抗力，是个体生存发展的基础[3-4]。 随着社会经济的发展和生活方式的转变，居民睡眠时间逐渐减少，睡眠问题发生率逐渐增高。新型冠状病毒肺炎(新冠肺炎)疫情的爆发进一步加重了睡眠问题。一项纳入近50万人的荟萃分析指出，新冠肺炎疫情期间全球大众睡眠问题的发生率高达40.5%[5]。我们团队开展的一项横断面调查发现，新冠肺炎疫情期间我国公众失眠发生率高达29.2%[6]。长期失眠可能会导致睡眠障碍的发生，睡眠障碍是一系列与睡眠相关疾病的统称，包含失眠障碍、睡眠呼吸障碍等。睡眠障碍的高发生率给个人、家庭和社会都造成了沉重负担[7]。另外，睡眠障碍可能会导致抑郁障碍、焦虑障碍等精神心理疾病的发生，也可能会增加心脏病、糖尿病、高血压等躯体疾病的发生风险或加重其病情[8-10]。因此，睡眠医学研究是脑科学领域的前沿问题和关系全民健康的关键问题。《健康中国行动(2019—2030年)》提倡成人每日平均睡眠时间要达到7~8 h[11]。维持良好的睡眠对提高国民健康水平和社会生产力、促进经济和社会可持续发展具有重要意义，是实现健康中国的必要条件。 我国睡眠研究起始于20世纪50年代，经过几十年的发展，在睡眠-觉醒机制、睡眠障碍发病机制与治疗手段开发等多方面取得了诸多重大进展。随着科学技术的发展及公众对睡眠的重视，睡眠障碍的临床诊疗水平也逐渐与国际接轨。2014年有文章综述了中国睡眠医学的过去、现在与未来，主要涉及睡眠医学学科发展现状及问题等[12]。本文将着重对我国睡眠医学研究现状及发展进行全面综述。 1. 我国现代睡眠医学的起源 20世纪初期，德国精神病学家Hans Berger首次在人类头皮上记录到脑电活动[13]，这一发现极大推动了世界睡眠医学的发展。20世纪70年代，欧美等发达国家对睡眠疾病日益重视，睡眠研究逐渐增多，睡眠研究会和睡眠中心等专业机构也相继建立。我国睡眠医学研究萌芽于20世纪50年代，河南医科大学王若雨教授率先开展睡眠基础理论研究工作，受限于历史环境等因素，研究进展缓慢[12]。随后二三十年里，我国睡眠医学研究主要以翻译国外研究成果、综述和著作为主[14-15]。至20世纪80年代，我国睡眠医学研究才逐渐开始发展。1981年，刘协和教授在四川医学院精神病学研究室创建了我国精神科第一个多导睡眠监测实验室，在国内率先开展了一系列睡眠障碍相关的研究，探索了不同精神疾病的睡眠特点。1986年，黄席珍教授在北京协和医院建立了国内第一家睡眠呼吸障碍诊疗中心。随后一年，中国科学院上海生命科学研究院刘世熠教授开始筹建中国睡眠研究会，该研究会于1994年正式成立。 1988年，第一项有关睡眠疾病的研究在国家自然科学基金项目中立项，资助金额仅有1.5万元。2009年9月国家自然科学基金委员会医学科学部成立，并专门设立“睡眠呼吸障碍”(代码为H0113)和“睡眠与睡眠障碍”(代码为H0916)两个亚方向用以资助睡眠研究。项目数量、类型及资助金额都有了大幅提升，极大促进了我国睡眠医学研究的全面发展。与此同时，北京大学医学部及附属医院在睡眠医学研究领域进行了很多积极的尝试。自2009年起，北京大学医学部形成了有关睡眠医学学科研究的战略设想及计划，探讨从医疗和研究的联合，到人员和机构的整合。综上，在众多专家和学者的不懈努力下，我国睡眠医学在上个世纪实现了从无到有的飞跃，开启了睡眠医学研究的新篇章。 2. 我国睡眠医学发展现状 2.1. 睡眠医学学科建设 睡眠医学是一门综合交叉学科，涉及精神科、神经科、呼吸科、耳鼻喉科、心血管科等多个学科，睡眠与精神疾病或心脑血管等多种重大慢性疾病有密切关联[16-17]，其重要性日益显现。目前，全国已有大量医院或高校建立了睡眠中心、睡眠监测室、睡眠研究室或睡眠门诊等，均依托于精神科、神经内科、呼吸科、耳鼻喉科或头颈外科等专业，各专业设立的睡眠研究室侧重于本专业疾病。为了促进睡眠医学多学科交叉融合，2014年北京大学医学部在陆林院士的主导下率先开设了“睡眠医学”的研究生课程，主要讲授常见睡眠障碍的发病机制、诊断及治疗、国内外睡眠医学的发展现状和睡眠研究技术与方法，以促进学生对睡眠医学基本理论、睡眠障碍发病机制和治疗原则等知识的理解和掌握。随后，国内多所高校也相继将“睡眠医学”课程纳入研究生培养方案中。国家卫生健康委员会“十三五”住院医师规范化培训第二轮规划教材新增《睡眠医学》。 目前欧美国家已将睡眠医学发展为独立学科，我国起步稍晚。世界卫生组织公布的《国际疾病分类第十一次修订本(ICD-11)》中将“睡眠-觉醒障碍”单独列为一章，彰显了睡眠疾病的独立性与重要性。世界卫生组织国际分类家族中国合作中心、中华医学会及有关医疗机构专家对ICD-11进行了编译，形成了《国际疾病分类第十一次修订本(ICD-11)中文版》。2019年6月，中国医师协会发布了《专科医师规范化培训专科目录(2019年版)》，睡眠医学正式被纳入培训目录名单，在住院医师规范化培训中，睡眠医学成为了主要培训内容，表明睡眠医学在国内将成为独立学科，与心血管等学科并列归属于内科，此举极大促进了睡眠医学从业人员交叉学科知识的培养和诊疗水平的提高。 2.2. 睡眠项目立项情况 近十年来，我国睡眠医学蓬勃发展，取得了长足进步。睡眠研究领域的项目立项数量和资助金额逐年增多，以国家自然科学基金为例，立项总数从1988—2009年的46项增加为2010—2019年的353项，资助总金额也从1988—2009年的1 076万元增加为2010—2019年的15 334.05万元[18]。2015年，由北京大学第六医院陆林院士牵头的我国首个睡眠研究领域国家重点基础研究发展计划(973计划)——“睡眠脑功能及其机制研究”获得科技部的立项，该项目以阐明睡眠脑功能及其机制、揭示睡眠的本质为总体目标，极大程度推动了我国睡眠医学的发展。2021年，科技创新2030“脑科学与类脑研究”重大项目(即“中国脑计划”)立项多个睡眠医学研究项目，包括睡眠与节律调节的神经机制、睡眠障碍的发病机制及干预技术研究等[19]，将进一步促进睡眠脑功能机制的全面解析及睡眠障碍诊疗水平的提高。 2.3. 睡眠领域突破性研究进展 在睡眠研究项目的资助下，近十年我国学者发表的睡眠研究文章数量逐年增加。以“sleep”和“China”为主题词在Web of Science网站检索发现，年发表文章数量从2011年的131篇增长至2021年的1 124篇。在睡眠-觉醒的生理机制、睡眠与认知、睡眠障碍与神经精神疾病及躯体疾病的关系及机制研究等多方面都取得了突破性进展。 2.3.1. 睡眠觉醒机制 近几年，我国学者在睡眠-觉醒的分子、细胞和环路机制等方面均取得了突破性的研究成果。陆军军医大学胡志安教授团队发现在睡眠-觉醒转换过程中，丘脑室旁核(paraventricular thalamus，PVT)的谷氨酸能神经元在清醒时表现出高活性，抑制PVT神经元的活性可导致觉醒减少，激活PVT神经元则可实现从睡眠到觉醒的转换[20]。该发现为嗜睡等疾病的治疗提供了新的干预靶点。复旦大学黄志力教授团队发现了伏隔核多巴胺(dopamine，DA)D1受体阳性神经元活性与觉醒高度相关，通过抑制中脑腹侧背盖区和外侧下丘脑中γ-氨基丁酸(γ-aminobutyric acid，GABA)能中间神经元，使DA能神经元和食欲素神经元去抑制，实现对觉醒行为的调控[21]。进一步研究发现由GABA能神经元组成的脑干结构——吻内侧被盖核在NREM睡眠的启动和维持中发挥重要作用，该脑区向中脑DA能神经元有广泛的纤维投射，促进NREM睡眠，并参与了睡眠内稳态的调控[22]。研究还证实了伏隔核-腹侧苍白球-中脑腹侧被盖区为调控动机行为和觉醒的神经环路，以及下丘脑室旁核对觉醒的调控作用[23-24]。以上研究为失眠障碍及相关疾病的临床治疗提供了新思路和潜在治疗靶点。浙江大学医学院郭方教授团队采用跨突触显示、钙成像等技术发现名为AOTU的脑区，它们支配着一群特殊的TuBu神经元，与睡眠稳态中心——椭球体EB-R2耦联，从而起到调节睡眠-觉醒转换的作用[25]。该研究为阐述昼夜节律环路和睡眠环路的连接机制提供了非常重要的依据。 2.3.2. 睡眠机制研究新技术 对神经递质浓度变化的快速特异性追踪为睡眠机制的探索起到了重要的推动作用。近年来，北京大学李毓龙教授团队开发了一系列具备高灵敏度和高细胞特异性的神经递质检测方法，对乙酰胆碱、DA、去甲肾上腺素(norepinephrine，NE)等在睡眠过程中发挥重要作用的神经递质进行了特异荧光探针的开发和优化。例如，开发了基于G蛋白偶联受体激活的乙酰胆碱探针，对乙酰胆碱的检测灵敏度可达到微摩尔浓度，实现了对乙酰胆碱的动态监测[26]；开发了DA探针，包括DA1m与DA1h两种，实现了对DA的亚细胞分辨率与亚秒级别动力学特性的检测，且具有良好的分子特异性[27]；基于人源NE受体开发了两种具有不同亲和力的探针，分别适用于指示NE的局部传递或体积传递，实现在体对NE与DA进行区分[28]。上述新型神经递质检测工具具有可遗传编码、高灵敏性、高特异性、快速的动力学反应等优势，为探索神经递质如何影响睡眠-觉醒提供了不可或缺的工具。 2.3.3. 睡眠与学习记忆 睡眠对于个体的学习记忆、决策、情绪加工等大脑高级认知功能的维持至关重要[3]。北京大学时杰教授团队和朱露莎教授团队合作发现，睡眠过程中唤起与价值信息相关的食物名称，可以促进食物价值信息的巩固，使得个体在觉醒后更容易提取与这些零食相关的正性价值信息，这表明睡眠期间的线索诱导过程可以灵活、有选择性地调节主观偏好[29]。该研究为在无意识状态下改变个体的不良饮食习惯(如挑食、厌食等行为)提供了新方向。北京师范大学秦绍正教授课题组和深圳大学吴佳慧教授课题组研究发现，负性情绪记忆习得后的睡眠使负性情绪记忆增强，更不容易被消除[30]，该研究为创伤后应激障碍(posttraumatic stress disorder, PTSD)等疾病的治疗策略制定提供了新思路。睡眠中的行为学干预也会影响记忆的表达和维持，北京大学第六医院陆林院士团队发现，慢波睡眠中条件性刺激的再暴露可以促进恐惧记忆的消退[31]，该研究得到了国际睡眠医学领域专家的高度肯定，为以病理性恐惧记忆为基础的疾病提供了一种“睡眠疗法”，具有潜在的临床应用价值。 2.3.4. 睡眠障碍与神经精神疾病 失眠障碍和呼吸相关睡眠障碍是最常见的睡眠障碍，且两者共病率较高，研究发现在呼吸相关睡眠障碍患者中失眠障碍的比例高达38%，失眠障碍患者中呼吸相关睡眠障碍也达到35%[32]。发作性睡病和不宁腿综合征也是常见的睡眠障碍，四川大学华西医院唐向东教授团队研究发现儿童发作性睡病患者较成人患者夜间觉醒更多，睡眠片段化更严重[33]。我们课题组荟萃分析发现，全球范围内孕期不宁腿综合征的患病率为21%，但在不同地区孕期不宁腿综合征的患病率不一致，欧洲地区为23%，西太平洋地区为11%，东地中海地区为30%，美洲地区为23%，且孕期不宁腿综合征的患病率随孕周延长而增大[34]。上述研究为了解睡眠障碍的患病率及疾病特征提供了全面且直观的数据，有助于相关政策的制定和疾病防治。睡眠障碍与多种神经精神疾病的发生密切相关[16]。北京大学第六医院陆林院士团队针对睡眠与痴呆的关系进行了全面的分析，发现睡眠障碍是痴呆发生的危险因素，不同类型的睡眠障碍在不同种类痴呆的发生和发展过程中扮演的角色不同：失眠障碍是阿尔兹海默症(Alzheimer’s disease，AD)发生的危险因素；呼吸相关睡眠障碍可同时增加AD和血管性痴呆的发生[35]，该研究提示痴呆相关的睡眠改变可作为早期干预痴呆的切入点，通过改善患者的睡眠以期减缓认知下降。四川大学华西医院唐向东教授团队开展荟萃分析发现，AD患者的慢波睡眠比例减少与痴呆严重度相关。在AD患者中观察到脑电图频率成分和睡眠纺锤波的改变，该变化可能是与AD诊断相关的生物标志物[36]。但睡眠-觉醒异常引起认知功能受损的病理机制目前尚不清楚，除中枢神经系统的调节外，肠道菌群也逐渐进入研究视野。我们的一项研究发现睡眠剥夺可导致人体肠道内短链脂肪酸的代谢水平改变，这种代谢改变可影响神经炎症水平，该研究首次从“微生物-肠-脑轴”角度揭示了睡眠剥夺导致认知受损的机制，为理解睡眠剥夺与神经炎症的关系提供了新的视角[37]。此外，唐向东教授团队还分析了多种神经精神疾病患者的睡眠结构特点，发现PTSD患者总睡眠时间和慢波睡眠减少，睡眠效率降低，且PTSD严重程度与睡眠效率和慢波睡眠百分比降低有关[38]。另一项荟萃分析发现，帕金森病患者的总睡眠时间、睡眠效率、NREM 2期百分比、慢波睡眠、REM睡眠百分比显著减少，表明相较于对照组，帕金森病患者的睡眠质量较差[39]。上述系列研究表明，睡眠紊乱可作为神经精神疾病发生和发展的重要生物学标志，具有潜在的临床诊断价值，进一步阐明了睡眠与神经精神疾病的关系。 2.3.5. 睡眠障碍与躯体疾病 我国研究者还深入探索了睡眠与心血管疾病之间的关系，香港中文大学荣润国教授团队开展了一项纳入UK Biobank数据库404 044人的研究，分析了睡眠时长与12种心血管疾病之间的因果关系，发现睡眠时长与高血压、房颤、肺栓塞和慢性缺血性心脏病呈负相关，提示睡眠时长过短(≤6 h)是高血压、房颤、肺栓塞和慢性缺血性心脏病的潜在风险因素[40]。唐向东教授团队发现失眠患者白天的觉醒过度可显著增加高血压的患病风险[41]。随后，通过客观评估阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停综合征(obstructive sleep apnea，OSA)患者的睡眠，发现其生理觉醒水平降低(即嗜睡)与高血压患病风险增加相关[42]，这一发现与该团队此前对失眠症患者的研究结果相反。唐教授团队进一步评估了慢波睡眠在OSA和高血压中的关系，发现慢波睡眠减少和OSA的相互作用增加了慢性高血压发生的概率[43]。上述研究不仅反映了睡眠障碍与心血管疾病之间的复杂关系，也为进一步探索相关机制与干预策略提供了新的线索。睡眠障碍与代谢类疾病的发生也有密切关系，上海市第六人民医院殷善开教授团队发现OSA与糖代谢异常有关，睡眠碎片化与高胰岛素血症独立相关，间歇性低氧与高血糖、高胰岛素血症和异常的胰岛素抵抗稳态模型评估独立相关[44]；该团队还发现脂代谢紊乱与OSA严重程度之间存在阶段异质性，提示应采用一种新的预测策略动态评估临床中OSA的风险进展[45]。中国台湾研究者对比分析了4 000余名不育男性和18 000余名对照者，发现OSA与不育风险增加有关[46]。以上系列研究为阐明睡眠障碍与躯体疾病的关系发挥了重大推动作用。 2.3.6. 睡眠障碍干预策略研发 与此同时，我国学者也在积极研发治疗失眠障碍的新型药物，例如，GABAα受体拮抗剂EVT-201胶囊已完成Ⅲ期临床试验，食欲素双受体拮抗剂莱博雷生、盐酸多塞平口颊膜片、YZJ-1139片、琥珀酸多西拉敏片、坤怡宁颗粒等正在进行Ⅲ期临床试验，马来酸咪达唑仑片、右佐匹克隆片、酒石酸唑吡坦片、佐匹克隆片、苯巴比妥片、艾司唑仑片等多种药物已完成人体生物等效性试验(http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/index.html)。目前，治疗过度嗜睡的新药替洛利生也正在开展临床试验。神经调控技术也被逐渐应用于睡眠医学领域，如经颅磁刺激、经颅直流电刺激、经颅交流电刺激等[47]。首都医科大学宣武医院王玉平教授团队在慢性失眠人群中开展了一项随机双盲临床试验，发现经颅交流电刺激治疗后，失眠患者的匹兹堡睡眠质量指数总分显著降低，睡眠效率提高，睡眠质量改善[48]。此外，经耳迷走神经刺激、生物反馈治疗、光照治疗等也在睡眠医学领域有广泛的应用前景。 2.4. 我国睡眠疾病诊疗现状及进展 近年来，我国学者在推动睡眠疾病诊疗能力提升方面也做出突出贡献，制定了多种睡眠障碍诊疗指南或专家共识，主要有《中国失眠障碍综合防治指南》《中国失眠障碍诊断和治疗指南》《中国成人失眠伴抑郁焦虑诊治专家共识》《中国儿童阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停诊断与治疗指南(2020)》《中国发作性睡病诊断与治疗指南》《不宁腿综合征的诊断标准和治疗指南》等。睡眠疾病指南和专家共识的建立将有助于提升我国睡眠医生的诊疗能力。2021年我国首部《中国睡眠医学中心标准化建设指南》正式出版，从多学科睡眠医学中心的人员建设、场地建设及硬件设施建设、睡眠障碍的规范化诊疗等多方面进行了全面介绍，该指南既有利于睡眠诊疗工作的进一步规范，也将促进我国睡眠医学的规范化建设与发展。 3. 我国睡眠医学发展方向 3.1. 加强睡眠医学专业人才培养及学科建设 将睡眠医学作为一门独立的学科体系是保障睡眠医学发展和睡眠专业人才培养的必要途径。目前，我国从事睡眠相关疾病诊疗工作的医务人员大多为精神科、神经内科、呼吸科等学科背景，对睡眠疾病的识别常从各自专业背景出发，存在一定的学科偏向性。因此，未来仍需大力促进不同学科之间的交叉合作，推动睡眠医学的规范化培训，促进跨学科人员对睡眠交叉知识的掌握和了解，推进跨学科诊疗指南的制订。相较于欧美国家完善的继续教育培训和资格考试制度，我国目前对睡眠技术人员的认证考核机制尚不健全，亟需开展睡眠技术规范化培训和认证体系建设，同时，医院和政府也应加大政策实施力度和经费投入，完善执业考核机制和继续教育机制，以更好地促进临床睡眠医学专业人才队伍的建设与发展。 3.2. 健全睡眠研究协作机制 近年来，随着全国各地睡眠研究机构的逐步建立，各研究中心收集的睡眠数据逐渐累积，但是却存在数据形式多样和数据管理不便等问题。将来需要各地区加强合作，探索睡眠医学协同创新体系新方向，建立全国多地区协作的睡眠研究体系，协同攻关，优势互补，实现系统性整合优化；搭建规范化、标准化、整合多维度指标的睡眠相关数据库及研究平台；强化多学科交叉，建立预测、诊疗和康复的多模态单共病一体化的信息挖掘方法，开创睡眠医学研究的新模式。 3.3. 促进睡眠医学诊疗智能化 随着人工智能和传感技术的发展，如今的医学诊疗模式正在向智能化方向发展。美国睡眠医学会发布意见书推荐睡眠远程医疗技术，即利用互联网和实时视频传输等方法对患者进行诊疗[49]。在新冠肺炎疫情期间，我国睡眠医学互联网诊疗已经得到一定程度的发展，如逐渐兴起的在线失眠认知行为治疗。未来睡眠诊疗服务应进一步结合人工智能等先进技术，在提高患者依从性的同时，提升智能化远程诊疗模式的诊疗效果，最终推动个人睡眠健康监测系统、智慧医院和区域睡眠管理平台的建设，满足人民日益增长的睡眠健康需求。但智能化远程诊疗模式的诊疗效果、患者依从性等仍需密切关注与评估，这一新兴医疗模式的发展依旧任重道远。 3.4. 推动睡眠机制解析和睡眠障碍干预新策略研发 2013年Nature发表文章提出“人类睡眠计划”，旨在通过多学科协作的方式发展新型干预手段，改善睡眠健康状况，提高生命质量[50]。随着2021年“中国脑计划”正式启动[19]，未来我国研究者将在睡眠-觉醒机制、睡眠节律、睡眠研究新技术、睡眠与学习记忆等多方面进一步开展系统深入的研究。同时，在国家级脑疾病临床研究大数据与样本库平台的支持下，我国将建立覆盖全生命周期的睡眠及睡眠障碍大样本数据库，结合基因组学、影像组学、计算神经科学、行为科学和生物信息学等方法深入探索睡眠的脑功能机制；融合多种神经监测与调控技术，全面解析睡眠障碍的发病机制；挖掘睡眠障碍的生物标志物和特异性干预靶点，加快新型药物研发；研发可穿戴式预警装置，从而建立标准化、个体化的睡眠监测和干预体系，实现对睡眠障碍的早期诊断和早期干预。在“中国脑计划”的引领下，我国学者有望在睡眠医学领域取得重大研究突破，以推动我国睡眠医学的飞跃发展。 4. 结语 目前，我国睡眠医学事业正处于蓬勃发展阶段，国家政府的大力支持、高水平科研机构的建立和专业人才队伍的积累，使我国在睡眠医学领域取得了一系列重要的研究成果，也显著提高了我国针对睡眠障碍的诊疗服务能力。但我们也应认清当下我国睡眠医学仍需要进一步发展。“中国脑计划”的启动为睡眠医学研究提供了良好的契机，并将推动睡眠医学走向更加光辉的未来。 Funding Statement

According to disease classification systems, sleep disorders can be categorized into more than 90 types, including sleep apnea, insomnia, and hypersomnia. It may cause a variety of adverse consequences, such as depression, anxiety and other emotional disorders, as well as physical diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and stroke. In addition, the relevant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment not only harm physical health, but also are associated with workplace accidents and safety problems, constituting public safety hazards. Sleep disorders have become a major social and scientific problem that impacts on the national economy and the livelihood of the people. Research on sleep disorders should be given more attention by researchers and policy makers. Herein, we mainly discussed the latest findings and difficulties concerning research on the prevention and intervention of sleep disorders and proposed strategies and suggestions accordingly. Keywords: Sleep disorders, Sleep research, Research on mental disorders, Prevention and control 睡眠是人类最基础的生理需求，睡眠不仅是维持机体正常生长发育的重要途径，还对记忆的稳定和整合起着至关重要的作用[1]。近年来，随着经济社会发展，人们受到生活工作压力增大以及生活方式变化等多重因素的影响，睡眠障碍问题日益凸显。睡眠障碍可影响身体、心理、社交和情绪功能，且在成人和儿童等各年龄阶段中都很常见。睡眠障碍种类很多，2017年，美国睡眠医学学会（The American Academy of Sleep Medicine）发布的《睡眠障碍国际分类第3版》（International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition, ICSD-3）将睡眠障碍主要分为七大类，包括失眠（insomnia）、睡眠相关呼吸障碍（sleep-related breathing disorders）、中枢性嗜睡症（central disorders of hypersomnolence）、昼夜节律睡眠-觉醒障碍（circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders）、睡眠异态（parasomnias）、睡眠相关运动障碍（sleep-related movement disorders）和其他睡眠障碍[2]。目前，睡眠障碍相关重大疾病研究已逐渐成为全球各国科技创新的重要布局方向之一，但该领域相关研究尚处于起步阶段，存在诸多瓶颈。我国睡眠医学起步较晚，且随着人口老龄化加剧，所面临的睡眠障碍相关重大疾病的防控挑战也与国际上有所不同。本文基于文献检索分析和专家咨询等方法，梳理了国内外睡眠障碍相关重大疾病的防控现状和挑战，并就下一步科技工作提出几点对策与建议，以期为未来睡眠医学领域的政策制定及研究、管理工作提供参考。 1. 全球睡眠障碍及相关重大疾病的防控面临瓶颈 2013年5月，美国发布《精神障碍诊断与统计手册（第五版）》（Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, DSM-5），将第四版中“原发性失眠症（primary insomnia）”的诊断改为失眠障碍（insomnia disorder）[3-4]，诊断标准包括入睡困难或维持睡眠困难或早醒且不能再入睡而影响日间社会功能，频率为每周至少出现3晚、持续3个月以上等[5]。然而，DSM-5以及ICSD-3对于失眠障碍诊断标准的调整或更新主要是针对临床或科研实践进行完善而不是发现了新的研究证据[6]。除此之外，睡眠呼吸障碍也是睡眠障碍中十分常见的一种，包括阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（obstructive sleep apnea, OSA）、中枢型睡眠呼吸暂停以及睡眠相关的低通气和低氧血症[7]。目前，睡眠障碍相关重大疾病研究成为全球各国脑科学领域布局的重要方向之一，包括近年来相继启动的美国的“大脑（BRAIN）”计划、欧盟的“神经退行性疾病联合研究（Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research, JPND）”计划、日本的“脑/思维（Brain/MINDS）”计划以及韩国脑计划（Korea Brain Initiative）等均涉及睡眠障碍发病机制及防治策略相关研究。总体来讲，全球睡眠障碍的相关探索研究尚处于起步阶段，主要存在以下两方面亟待解决的重要问题： 一是诊断上缺乏客观生物学标准。临床检查手段可反映的患者生物学标志信息十分有限，大多依赖问卷调查，缺乏预测模型以及评估患者预后的客观方法。关于睡眠障碍的神经机理研究多采用脑电图及多导睡眠图等作为主要技术手段，只能反映大脑皮层大尺度范围内的神经元集体电活动信息，难以全面揭示复杂神经环路和脑网络特征。通过功能磁共振成像等技术虽可为睡眠障碍的神经机理研究提供新视角，但单一研究模式所获信息仍有局限，无法全面反映脑网络和神经环路的信息流动。目前，各国都在推进该领域科研攻关，旨在通过整合多导睡眠图、多模态成像技术等新型及传统脑功能研究手段，进行睡眠障碍不同维度脑网络的精准构建和深入分析，结合人群队列随访研究，深入理解睡眠障碍及相关疾病脑功能的生理学变化机制，促进睡眠障碍干预技术创新，为睡眠障碍诊疗水平提升保驾护航。 二是临床干预手段有限。现有干预手段难以达到临床治愈，均以对症为主，主要包括药物及非药物治疗。药物治疗存在多种不良反应，不适宜作为长期治疗手段。美国睡眠医学学会建议进行心理和行为干预，并辅以短期药物治疗[8-9]，心理和行为介入包括失眠认知行为疗法（CBT-I）、单/多成分干预行为疗法和认知重建以及睡眠卫生教育等手段[10]。近年来，随着人工智能技术及大数据的发展，国内外开发了许多远程CBT-I 治疗方式，然而这类非药物治疗存在操作复杂、经济成本高等缺点，限制了其在中低收入国家的推广应用。 上述困境的主要原因是大脑在睡眠障碍相关疾病中的功能变化及神经、遗传机制尚不明确，睡眠障碍的特异性标志物和风险因素也尚未阐明。这些关键性问题已成为寻找睡眠障碍个体化诊断体系的最大障碍，也是对其进行高效干预及疗效评价的瓶颈所在。 2. 我国睡眠障碍防控研究现状及面临的挑战 随着社会现代化和老龄化发展，睡眠障碍发病率迅速升高，以睡眠-觉醒障碍为例，全球发病率为27%，而我国高达38.2%[11-12]。根据我国睡眠研究会2021年3月发布的《2021年运动与睡眠白皮书》显示，我国有3亿多人面临睡眠障碍及相关问题[13]。 我国的睡眠医学研究起步较晚，开始于20世纪50年代，直到1994年，中国睡眠研究会正式成立后才逐渐发展进步[14]。此后，我国科研人员发表与睡眠相关文章的数量逐年增加。基于ClinicalTrials.gov注册平台的检索结果显示，2005年开始，我国科研人员参与的临床试验数量逐渐上升。截至目前，我国睡眠医学临床试验注册总量位居全球第三位（图1）。2014年以来，科技部、国家卫生健康委员会、中央军委后勤保障部和国家药品监督管理局共同布局建设了3家精神心理疾病领域的国家临床医学研究中心，现已初步形成了多地区协同的创新网络，搭建睡眠障碍相关临床研究的国家级平台，大力促进我国睡眠医学研究发展。2021年底，国内发布了首部《中国睡眠医学中心标准化建设指南》，该指南在借鉴国内外睡眠医学中心建设先进经验的基础上，结合我国睡眠医学中心建设的现状，为我国睡眠医学中心标准化建设与发展提供了依据和参考[15]。 自2009年开始，我国逐渐增加睡眠医学研究经费投入，总资助金额从 1988−2009 年的1000余万元增加为2010−2019年的1.5亿元[16]，“十二五”期间，国家自然科学基金委共批准150余项睡眠相关的课题项目，总金额达7500余万元[17]。“十四五”以来，通过国家重点研发计划“常见多发病防治研究”重点专项和科技部科技创新2030−“脑科学与类脑研究”重大项目等国家科技计划的部署，重点围绕睡眠障碍的发病机制、新型干预手段以及人群队列的建设进行攻关，以期进一步阐明相关作用机制，开发出睡眠障碍的新型干预手段。 尽管如此，我国睡眠障碍的防控工作仍面临以下四方面问题： 一是我国睡眠障碍人群的遗传特点与国外差异较大。睡眠-觉醒障碍、OSA等常见的睡眠障碍均系受到基因与环境交互作用影响的复杂多基因遗传病。近年来，复杂疾病遗传机制研究范式从单个致病基因研究转变为以基因、转录、蛋白、代谢多组学检测及关键分子调控网络分析为基础的系统生物学模式，而我国无论是睡眠障碍患者人群的风险位点研究，还是多组学研究均与国外存在一定差距。同时，因遗传异质性导致我国与其他亚、欧人群存在巨大差异，开展国人睡眠障碍疾病遗传研究，对于国人睡眠障碍相关疾病新基因靶点的发现、病因及发病机制的揭示十分必要，结合神经影像与神经调控技术的开发，将为进一步明确睡眠障碍的发病机制、探索全新治疗模式及精准医疗奠定基础。 二是现有临床干预手段仍存在局限性。针对慢性失眠的药物治疗存在“成瘾”风险，而如CBT-I等非药物治疗需要患者长期配合，在我国专业人员数量相对不足的背景下，难以满足患者的治疗需求[18]。此外，由于缺乏对慢性失眠发生发展机制的深入了解，我国临床上的治疗以对症为主，亟需开发特异性、针对性的新型治疗手段并进行临床验证和推广。近年来，相关科研成果不断涌现，一些新型非药物干预手段在慢性失眠防控中的发展潜力也逐渐体现，例如基于声、光、电和磁等刺激开发的新型技术（基于影像导航的Theta爆发式经颅磁刺激技术、闭环-经颅交流电刺激等）具有针对性强和安全性高等优点[19]，但其有效性尚未得到验证，具体治疗机制仍未阐明。 另一方面，对于OSA这一常见睡眠障碍，持续气道正压通气（continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP）是临床一线治疗方式。然而，我国近三分之二的OSA患者在明确诊断后拒绝接受治疗[20]。这可能与以下几点因素相关：①针对OSA这一疾病的宣教不足；②患者临床症状与OSA严重程度不匹配，超过60%的OSA患者日间疲乏等功能损害症状轻微，从而主观臆测自身病情不够严重，无需进行医疗干预[19]；③患者需自费购买治疗设备，治疗费用相对昂贵。同时，即使在选择接受治疗的人群中，我国OSA患者的治疗依从性差，仅有约30%～50%的OSA患者显示出对治疗依从，显著低于西方国家60%～70%的治疗依从率[21-22]。CPAP临床依从性差这一问题在我国尤其严重[21, 23]。 三是我国诊疗资源分布局限，缺乏智能化分级诊疗体系。我国睡眠障碍患者人数众多，且年龄段分布广泛，从儿童到老年人阶段均可能出现不同临床亚型的睡眠障碍，严重危害心身健康。此外，新型冠状病毒感染或加剧睡眠障碍的发生风险[24]。然而，我国睡眠医疗资源存在分布不均现象，部分三甲医院以及少数的二级医院设有睡眠障碍专科门诊和独立的睡眠监测室及治疗室，诊疗与患者需求的供需不平衡现象突出。我国目前的分级诊疗体系有待完善，由于各医院影像质量控制标准和实现程度不一，导致在医联体内推行影像互通互认存在一定难度[25]，迫切需要实行数据标准统一的智能化分级诊疗平台[26]。 四是睡眠障碍相关问题的公众认识水平有待提高[27]。多数人对于睡眠障碍问题不够重视，或存在睡眠健康知识误区，例如认为失眠不是病，或相关症状可以通过补觉代替[28]，饮酒助眠[29]，鼾声越大睡得越香等[30]。此外，因老年人对功能失调性睡眠障碍的心理机制了解不足，导致老年人安全感降低，加剧诱发失眠[31]。为此，国家卫生健康委员会发布的《健康中国行动（2019−2030年）》明确强调要重视睡眠健康，将改善睡眠纳入主要行动指标，并提出了一系列明确的目标要求[32]，以期提高公众对睡眠障碍重视程度，减轻国人睡眠障碍疾病医疗负担及相关经济损失。 3. 有关对策建议 为进一步促进我国睡眠医学研究发展，全面开展睡眠障碍相关疾病脑网络特征与神经、遗传调控机制的研究；阐明睡眠障碍发生发展机制；探索其遗传易感性及脑影像表征；建立早期诊断的综合预警体系和个体化干预策略等新型手段并进行临床验证和推广，是睡眠障碍及相关重大疾病防治的关键。具体建议包括以下三方面： 3.1. 统筹科研部署，完善睡眠障碍相关研究体系 将目前已布局项目进行整合，促进我国睡眠障碍相关研究优势力量和不同地区之间的相互协作，对标国际上睡眠障碍防控研究的前沿进展和趋势，找准科技突破口，进一步明确我国睡眠障碍防控研究的近期、中期和远期目标及任务。加强调动院所、高校、企业的创新积极性，建立基于不同临床亚型的睡眠障碍多中心大队列，实现疾病靶标发现，并构建适宜中国人群的睡眠障碍风险预测模型和预后评估体系，为临床决策和优化医疗资源配置提供循证依据；完成重大关键技术突破以及重点睡眠产品的开发，为提高失眠障碍诊断的敏感性和特异性提供积极有效的科技支撑。 3.2. 推进跨学科合作，深化睡眠障碍的发病机制研究 应用神经调控技术（重复经颅磁刺激、经颅电刺激等）探索睡眠障碍的个体化干预方式有助于克服传统镇静催眠类药物对患者造成依赖性及成瘾性的弊端，且符合睡眠障碍个体化诊疗探索的国际趋势。因此，将神经调控技术与神经影像、电生理、神经内分泌、分子遗传、蛋白组学、肠道微生物等多学科技术融合，有助于明确睡眠障碍的发生发展机制，推动神经调控技术干预睡眠障碍的理论创新和个体化诊疗技术创新。 3.3. 强化我国精神心理疾病领域国家临床医学研究中心的辐射带动作用 以国家临床医学研究中心为依托，以临床应用为导向，构建完整系统的大型中国睡眠障碍人群队列，持续跟踪随访，采集睡眠障碍患者神经影像、电生理、神经内分泌、分子遗传、蛋白组学、肠道微生物数据，结合动物实验，探索不同种类睡眠障碍的有效预测因素和疾病预测模型，提出睡眠障碍调控新理论，为我国睡眠障碍相关诊疗方案的制定提供基础与临床科学证据。 总之，睡眠障碍的防控研究是关系国民健康和国民经济的重要问题，目前我国在该领域的研究应用正加速发展。科研攻关方面，国家科技计划的支持力度不断提升，未来建议进一步增强该领域科研人才培养，注重与信息技术等多学科的交叉融合，以突破现有技术瓶颈；在临床实践方面，未来建议注重基层心理和行为干预领域的专业人员培养，缓解医患供需不平衡的问题，并进一步注重搭建智能化的分级诊疗平台，充分发挥人工智能等创新技术在医疗服务和健康管理等方面的优势。

              "content": "概述 多导睡眠图又称睡眠监测，是一种用于诊断睡眠障碍的检测。多导睡眠图记录您在睡眠期间的脑电波、血液含氧量以及心率和呼吸，还可以测量眼球和腿部移动。 睡眠研究可在医院内的睡眠障碍病房或睡眠中心进行。检查通常在晚上进行。如果因工作安排而通常在白天睡觉，也可以在白天进行。 除了诊断，如果您已被诊断出睡眠障碍，睡眠研究可以帮助制定治疗计划，还可以用来调整您的治疗。 有时您也可以在家中完成睡眠研究。居家睡眠呼吸暂停检测用于帮助诊断阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停。 如果您在家做睡眠研究，可以使用不同类型的器械。每个器械使用不同的传感器组合。居家睡眠呼吸暂停检测通常会记录您的呼吸率和气流，以及氧气水平和心率。居家检测结果还可能包括血管方面的信息。 产品与服务 目的 多导睡眠图可以监测您的睡眠阶段和周期，从而识别您的睡眠模式是否被打扰、发生在何时以及原因。 正常入睡过程的第一个睡眠阶段称为非快速眼动期（也称为 NREM）睡眠。这个阶段的脑电波会变慢。睡眠监测使用一种被称为脑电图（即 EEG）的检查记录这一睡眠阶段。 在一到两个小时的 NREM 后，大脑活动重新加速。这个睡眠阶段被称为快速眼动期（即 REM）睡眠。在 REM 睡眠期间，您的眼球会快速前后移动。大多数梦境发生在这个阶段。 在一晚睡眠中，您通常会经历多个睡眠周期。您的睡眠周期大约为 90 分钟，在NREM 和 REM 睡眠之间切换。但是睡眠障碍可能扰乱这个睡眠过程。 如果您怀疑自己存在以下状况，医务人员可能建议您接受睡眠监测： - 睡眠呼吸暂停或另一种睡眠相关呼吸障碍。 出现这种状况时，睡眠期间的呼吸会反复停止和开始。 - 周期性肢体运动障碍。 这种睡眠障碍的患者在睡觉时会弯曲和伸展双腿。这种状况有时与不宁腿综合征有关。不宁腿综合征会导致患者在清醒状态下不自主地移动双腿，通常是在晚上或临睡时。 - 发作性睡病。 发作性睡病患者白天感到极度困倦，并且可能突然睡着。 - 快速眼动睡眠行为障碍。 这种睡眠障碍与梦游有关。 - 睡眠期间的行为。 这包括在睡眠中行走、走动或有节奏地运动。 - 长期失眠。 失眠患者很难入睡或维持睡眠状态。 风险 多导睡眠脑电图是一种无创、无痛的检测方法。最常见的副作用是胶带（用于将检测传感器粘到皮肤上）引起的皮肤刺激。 如何进行准备 在进行睡眠研究之前的下午和晚上不要摄入含酒精或咖啡因的饮料或食物。酒精和咖啡因可能会改变您的睡眠模式，并且可能会加重某些睡眠障碍的症状。也不要在睡眠研究之前午睡。 您可能需要在睡眠研究前泡澡或淋浴。但在检查前不要涂抹乳液、凝胶、香水或化妆品。这些物质可能会干扰检查中使用的传感器（称为电极）。 如果进行居家睡眠呼吸暂停检测，会将检测设备配送到您家中。或者，您可以前往医务人员的诊室领取设备。您将收到有关如何使用该设备的指示。如果您不确定如何进行检测或使用设备，请大胆提问。 可能出现的情况 多导睡眠脑电图检查期间 如果要在睡眠中心进行睡眠检查，您需要在晚上入院并在这里过夜。您可以携带平时准备就寝时使用的物品。也可以穿自己的睡衣睡觉。 如果进行居家睡眠呼吸暂停检测，应遵循您平常的就寝时间。您需要将传感器放在身上，并按照提供给您的说明书打开机器。医务人员可能请您记录睡眠日记。 如果您在睡眠中心，进行多导睡眠图的房间类似于酒店房间，在检查过程中昏暗寂静。您不会与其他人同住。每个房间都有独立浴室。 睡眠区通常会有一个弱光摄像机，以便多导睡眠图技术人员在灯光熄灭时看到房间里的实时情况。房间还有音频系统，以便技术人员可以在房间外面的监视区域与您交谈并听到您的声音。 在您准备好就寝后，一名技术人员会放置传感器。将用胶水之类的温和黏合剂或胶带把传感器粘贴在您的头皮、太阳穴、胸部和腿部。传感器通过导线连至电脑。导线长度足以让您在床上移动。您还会在手指或耳朵上夹一个小夹子。这可以监测您的血氧水平。 在您睡眠时，技术人员会监测您的以下体征： - 脑波。 - 眼动。 - 心率。 - 呼吸模式。 - 血氧水平。 - 身体姿势。 - 胸部和腹部运动。 - 肢体运动。 - 打鼾和其他噪音。 技术人员会整夜监测您的情况。如果需要帮助，您可以通过监视设备与他们交谈。如果需要起床，技术人员可以进入房间帮您取下电线。 在检查过程中，技术人员可能会让您尝试使用气道正压通气（PAP）机器来缓解睡眠呼吸暂停。这种装置包括一个密封的鼻套或面罩，通过它输送柔和的气流，以帮助您呼吸。 持续气道正压通气（CPAP）设备是一种 PAP 机器。CPAP 设备提供恒定的空气流，让您睡觉时保持气道通畅。 对于某些人来说，选择双水平气道正压通气（BPAP）机器可能更加舒适。这些设备在您吸气时提供较高的压力，而在您呼气时提供较低的压力。 您可能有机会在睡眠检查开始之前试用 PAP 设备。这样当技术人员在晚上晚些时候建议您试用该设备时，您就不会感到陌生。如有必要，在检查过程中也可以使用氧气来辅助呼吸。 在睡眠中心，您可能不会像在家中那样容易入睡或者睡得那么舒适，但这通常不会影响检查结果。要获得准确的多导睡眠图结果，并不需要睡一整夜。 多导睡眠脑电图后 在睡眠中心完成多导睡眠图后，取下传感器后即可离开。您需要找建议您做检查的医务人员复诊。完成多导睡眠监测后，您可以恢复正常活动。 进行居家睡眠呼吸暂停检测后，您可以在早晨醒来后取下传感器。您需要将检测设备还回或寄回医务人员办公室。现在有些居家睡眠呼吸暂停检测为一次性检测，因此可以在检测结束后丢弃检测设备。 结果 睡眠研究期间记录的测量数据可提供有关您的睡眠方式的大量信息。例如： - 睡眠期间的脑波和眼动可以帮助医护团队评估睡眠阶段。这有助于识别睡眠阶段的受干扰情况。发作性睡病或快速眼动睡眠行为障碍等睡眠障碍可能会导致睡眠阶段受干扰。 - 睡眠过程中出现异常的心率和呼吸频率变化以及血氧变化，都可能表明存在睡眠呼吸暂停问题。 - 使用 PAP 或氧气可以帮助医务人员了解最适合您的设备设置。如果医务人员计划开处设备供您在家使用，这很有帮助。 - 干扰您睡眠的频繁腿部运动可能表明您存在周期性肢体运动障碍。 - 睡眠期间的运动或行为可能是快速眼动睡眠行为障碍或另一种睡眠障碍的征兆。 多导睡眠图技师会先对睡眠监测期间收集的信息进行评估，然后使用这些数据来绘制您的睡眠阶段和周期图。然后，医务人员会审查这些信息。 如果已做过居家睡眠呼吸暂停检测，医务人员会审查检测期间收集的信息。可能需要几天或几周才能获得结果。 医务人员会在复诊时与您一起查看结果。医务人员会根据收集的数据讨论您可能需要的任何治疗或其他评估。 如果您做过居家睡眠呼吸暂停检测，有时结果并不能提供足够的信息。这种情况下，医务人员可能建议您到睡眠中心做睡眠研究。 临床试验 探索 Mayo Clinic 的研究 测试新的治疗、干预与检查方法，旨在预防、检测、治疗或控制这种疾病。 - Broaddus VC, et al., eds.

              "content": "Abstract 个体睡眠质量可影响机体重要生理功能，是调控信息、记忆决策等重要脑功能的关键生理因素。睡眠障碍按照疾病种类可细分为90余种，包括睡眠呼吸暂停、失眠、嗜睡等，可造成多种不良后果，如抑郁焦虑等情绪障碍和高血压、糖尿病、脑卒中等躯体疾病。此外，与其相关的心脑血管疾病及认知功能损害不仅危害身体健康，还易引发各类生产安全事故，构成公共安全隐患。睡眠障碍已成为影响国计民生的重大社会和科学问题，是我国亟须重视的研究领域。本文主要探讨国内外睡眠障碍相关防控研究进展及挑战，并提出相应对策与建议。 Keywords: 睡眠障碍, 睡眠研究, 精神障碍研究, 防控 Abstract The quality of sleep, a key physiological factor that regulates information, memory, decision making, and other vital brain functions, can affect important physiological functions of the human body. According to disease classification systems, sleep disorders can be categorized into more than 90 types, including sleep apnea, insomnia, and hypersomnia. It may cause a variety of adverse consequences, such as depression, anxiety and other emotional disorders, as well as physical diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and stroke. In addition, the relevant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive impairment not only harm physical health, but also are associated with workplace accidents and safety problems, constituting public safety hazards. Sleep disorders have become a major social and scientific problem that impacts on the national economy and the livelihood of the people. Research on sleep disorders should be given more attention by researchers and policy makers. Herein, we mainly discussed the latest findings and difficulties concerning research on the prevention and intervention of sleep disorders and proposed strategies and suggestions accordingly. Keywords: Sleep disorders, Sleep research, Research on mental disorders, Prevention and control 睡眠是人类最基础的生理需求，睡眠不仅是维持机体正常生长发育的重要途径，还对记忆的稳定和整合起着至关重要的作用[1]。近年来，随着经济社会发展，人们受到生活工作压力增大以及生活方式变化等多重因素的影响，睡眠障碍问题日益凸显。睡眠障碍可影响身体、心理、社交和情绪功能，且在成人和儿童等各年龄阶段中都很常见。睡眠障碍种类很多，2017年，美国睡眠医学学会（The American Academy of Sleep Medicine）发布的《睡眠障碍国际分类第3版》（International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition, ICSD-3）将睡眠障碍主要分为七大类，包括失眠（insomnia）、睡眠相关呼吸障碍（sleep-related breathing disorders）、中枢性嗜睡症（central disorders of hypersomnolence）、昼夜节律睡眠-觉醒障碍（circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders）、睡眠异态（parasomnias）、睡眠相关运动障碍（sleep-related movement disorders）和其他睡眠障碍[2]。目前，睡眠障碍相关重大疾病研究已逐渐成为全球各国科技创新的重要布局方向之一，但该领域相关研究尚处于起步阶段，存在诸多瓶颈。我国睡眠医学起步较晚，且随着人口老龄化加剧，所面临的睡眠障碍相关重大疾病的防控挑战也与国际上有所不同。本文基于文献检索分析和专家咨询等方法，梳理了国内外睡眠障碍相关重大疾病的防控现状和挑战，并就下一步科技工作提出几点对策与建议，以期为未来睡眠医学领域的政策制定及研究、管理工作提供参考。 1. 全球睡眠障碍及相关重大疾病的防控面临瓶颈 2013年5月，美国发布《精神障碍诊断与统计手册（第五版）》（Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, DSM-5），将第四版中“原发性失眠症（primary insomnia）”的诊断改为失眠障碍（insomnia disorder）[3-4]，诊断标准包括入睡困难或维持睡眠困难或早醒且不能再入睡而影响日间社会功能，频率为每周至少出现3晚、持续3个月以上等[5]。然而，DSM-5以及ICSD-3对于失眠障碍诊断标准的调整或更新主要是针对临床或科研实践进行完善而不是发现了新的研究证据[6]。除此之外，睡眠呼吸障碍也是睡眠障碍中十分常见的一种，包括阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（obstructive sleep apnea, OSA）、中枢型睡眠呼吸暂停以及睡眠相关的低通气和低氧血症[7]。目前，睡眠障碍相关重大疾病研究成为全球各国脑科学领域布局的重要方向之一，包括近年来相继启动的美国的“大脑（BRAIN）”计划、欧盟的“神经退行性疾病联合研究（Joint Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research, JPND）”计划、日本的“脑/思维（Brain/MINDS）”计划以及韩国脑计划（Korea Brain Initiative）等均涉及睡眠障碍发病机制及防治策略相关研究。总体来讲，全球睡眠障碍的相关探索研究尚处于起步阶段，主要存在以下两方面亟待解决的重要问题： 一是诊断上缺乏客观生物学标准。临床检查手段可反映的患者生物学标志信息十分有限，大多依赖问卷调查，缺乏预测模型以及评估患者预后的客观方法。关于睡眠障碍的神经机理研究多采用脑电图及多导睡眠图等作为主要技术手段，只能反映大脑皮层大尺度范围内的神经元集体电活动信息，难以全面揭示复杂神经环路和脑网络特征。通过功能磁共振成像等技术虽可为睡眠障碍的神经机理研究提供新视角，但单一研究模式所获信息仍有局限，无法全面反映脑网络和神经环路的信息流动。目前，各国都在推进该领域科研攻关，旨在通过整合多导睡眠图、多模态成像技术等新型及传统脑功能研究手段，进行睡眠障碍不同维度脑网络的精准构建和深入分析，结合人群队列随访研究，深入理解睡眠障碍及相关疾病脑功能的生理学变化机制，促进睡眠障碍干预技术创新，为睡眠障碍诊疗水平提升保驾护航。 二是临床干预手段有限。现有干预手段难以达到临床治愈，均以对症为主，主要包括药物及非药物治疗。药物治疗存在多种不良反应，不适宜作为长期治疗手段。美国睡眠医学学会建议进行心理和行为干预，并辅以短期药物治疗[8-9]，心理和行为介入包括失眠认知行为疗法（CBT-I）、单/多成分干预行为疗法和认知重建以及睡眠卫生教育等手段[10]。近年来，随着人工智能技术及大数据的发展，国内外开发了许多远程CBT-I 治疗方式，然而这类非药物治疗存在操作复杂、经济成本高等缺点，限制了其在中低收入国家的推广应用。 上述困境的主要原因是大脑在睡眠障碍相关疾病中的功能变化及神经、遗传机制尚不明确，睡眠障碍的特异性标志物和风险因素也尚未阐明。这些关键性问题已成为寻找睡眠障碍个体化诊断体系的最大障碍，也是对其进行高效干预及疗效评价的瓶颈所在。 2. 我国睡眠障碍防控研究现状及面临的挑战 随着社会现代化和老龄化发展，睡眠障碍发病率迅速升高，以睡眠-觉醒障碍为例，全球发病率为27%，而我国高达38.2%[11-12]。根据我国睡眠研究会2021年3月发布的《2021年运动与睡眠白皮书》显示，我国有3亿多人面临睡眠障碍及相关问题[13]。 我国的睡眠医学研究起步较晚，开始于20世纪50年代，直到1994年，中国睡眠研究会正式成立后才逐渐发展进步[14]。此后，我国科研人员发表与睡眠相关文章的数量逐年增加。基于ClinicalTrials.gov注册平台的检索结果显示，2005年开始，我国科研人员参与的临床试验数量逐渐上升。截至目前，我国睡眠医学临床试验注册总量位居全球第三位（图1）。2014年以来，科技部、国家卫生健康委员会、中央军委后勤保障部和国家药品监督管理局共同布局建设了3家精神心理疾病领域的国家临床医学研究中心，现已初步形成了多地区协同的创新网络，搭建睡眠障碍相关临床研究的国家级平台，大力促进我国睡眠医学研究发展。2021年底，国内发布了首部《中国睡眠医学中心标准化建设指南》，该指南在借鉴国内外睡眠医学中心建设先进经验的基础上，结合我国睡眠医学中心建设的现状，为我国睡眠医学中心标准化建设与发展提供了依据和参考[15]。 自2009年开始，我国逐渐增加睡眠医学研究经费投入，总资助金额从 1988−2009 年的1000余万元增加为2010−2019年的1.5亿元[16]，“十二五”期间，国家自然科学基金委共批准150余项睡眠相关的课题项目，总金额达7500余万元[17]。“十四五”以来，通过国家重点研发计划“常见多发病防治研究”重点专项和科技部科技创新2030−“脑科学与类脑研究”重大项目等国家科技计划的部署，重点围绕睡眠障碍的发病机制、新型干预手段以及人群队列的建设进行攻关，以期进一步阐明相关作用机制，开发出睡眠障碍的新型干预手段。 尽管如此，我国睡眠障碍的防控工作仍面临以下四方面问题： 一是我国睡眠障碍人群的遗传特点与国外差异较大。睡眠-觉醒障碍、OSA等常见的睡眠障碍均系受到基因与环境交互作用影响的复杂多基因遗传病。近年来，复杂疾病遗传机制研究范式从单个致病基因研究转变为以基因、转录、蛋白、代谢多组学检测及关键分子调控网络分析为基础的系统生物学模式，而我国无论是睡眠障碍患者人群的风险位点研究，还是多组学研究均与国外存在一定差距。同时，因遗传异质性导致我国与其他亚、欧人群存在巨大差异，开展国人睡眠障碍疾病遗传研究，对于国人睡眠障碍相关疾病新基因靶点的发现、病因及发病机制的揭示十分必要，结合神经影像与神经调控技术的开发，将为进一步明确睡眠障碍的发病机制、探索全新治疗模式及精准医疗奠定基础。 二是现有临床干预手段仍存在局限性。针对慢性失眠的药物治疗存在“成瘾”风险，而如CBT-I等非药物治疗需要患者长期配合，在我国专业人员数量相对不足的背景下，难以满足患者的治疗需求[18]。此外，由于缺乏对慢性失眠发生发展机制的深入了解，我国临床上的治疗以对症为主，亟需开发特异性、针对性的新型治疗手段并进行临床验证和推广。近年来，相关科研成果不断涌现，一些新型非药物干预手段在慢性失眠防控中的发展潜力也逐渐体现，例如基于声、光、电和磁等刺激开发的新型技术（基于影像导航的Theta爆发式经颅磁刺激技术、闭环-经颅交流电刺激等）具有针对性强和安全性高等优点[19]，但其有效性尚未得到验证，具体治疗机制仍未阐明。 另一方面，对于OSA这一常见睡眠障碍，持续气道正压通气（continuous positive airway pressure, CPAP）是临床一线治疗方式。然而，我国近三分之二的OSA患者在明确诊断后拒绝接受治疗[20]。这可能与以下几点因素相关：①针对OSA这一疾病的宣教不足；②患者临床症状与OSA严重程度不匹配，超过60%的OSA患者日间疲乏等功能损害症状轻微，从而主观臆测自身病情不够严重，无需进行医疗干预[19]；③患者需自费购买治疗设备，治疗费用相对昂贵。同时，即使在选择接受治疗的人群中，我国OSA患者的治疗依从性差，仅有约30%～50%的OSA患者显示出对治疗依从，显著低于西方国家60%～70%的治疗依从率[21-22]。CPAP临床依从性差这一问题在我国尤其严重[21, 23]。 三是我国诊疗资源分布局限，缺乏智能化分级诊疗体系。我国睡眠障碍患者人数众多，且年龄段分布广泛，从儿童到老年人阶段均可能出现不同临床亚型的睡眠障碍，严重危害心身健康。此外，新型冠状病毒感染或加剧睡眠障碍的发生风险[24]。然而，我国睡眠医疗资源存在分布不均现象，部分三甲医院以及少数的二级医院设有睡眠障碍专科门诊和独立的睡眠监测室及治疗室，诊疗与患者需求的供需不平衡现象突出。我国目前的分级诊疗体系有待完善，由于各医院影像质量控制标准和实现程度不一，导致在医联体内推行影像互通互认存在一定难度[25]，迫切需要实行数据标准统一的智能化分级诊疗平台[26]。 四是睡眠障碍相关问题的公众认识水平有待提高[27]。多数人对于睡眠障碍问题不够重视，或存在睡眠健康知识误区，例如认为失眠不是病，或相关症状可以通过补觉代替[28]，饮酒助眠[29]，鼾声越大睡得越香等[30]。此外，因老年人对功能失调性睡眠障碍的心理机制了解不足，导致老年人安全感降低，加剧诱发失眠[31]。为此，国家卫生健康委员会发布的《健康中国行动（2019−2030年）》明确强调要重视睡眠健康，将改善睡眠纳入主要行动指标，并提出了一系列明确的目标要求[32]，以期提高公众对睡眠障碍重视程度，减轻国人睡眠障碍疾病医疗负担及相关经济损失。 3. 有关对策建议 为进一步促进我国睡眠医学研究发展，全面开展睡眠障碍相关疾病脑网络特征与神经、遗传调控机制的研究；阐明睡眠障碍发生发展机制；探索其遗传易感性及脑影像表征；建立早期诊断的综合预警体系和个体化干预策略等新型手段并进行临床验证和推广，是睡眠障碍及相关重大疾病防治的关键。具体建议包括以下三方面： 3.1. 统筹科研部署，完善睡眠障碍相关研究体系 将目前已布局项目进行整合，促进我国睡眠障碍相关研究优势力量和不同地区之间的相互协作，对标国际上睡眠障碍防控研究的前沿进展和趋势，找准科技突破口，进一步明确我国睡眠障碍防控研究的近期、中期和远期目标及任务。加强调动院所、高校、企业的创新积极性，建立基于不同临床亚型的睡眠障碍多中心大队列，实现疾病靶标发现，并构建适宜中国人群的睡眠障碍风险预测模型和预后评估体系，为临床决策和优化医疗资源配置提供循证依据；完成重大关键技术突破以及重点睡眠产品的开发，为提高失眠障碍诊断的敏感性和特异性提供积极有效的科技支撑。 3.2. 推进跨学科合作，深化睡眠障碍的发病机制研究 应用神经调控技术（重复经颅磁刺激、经颅电刺激等）探索睡眠障碍的个体化干预方式有助于克服传统镇静催眠类药物对患者造成依赖性及成瘾性的弊端，且符合睡眠障碍个体化诊疗探索的国际趋势。因此，将神经调控技术与神经影像、电生理、神经内分泌、分子遗传、蛋白组学、肠道微生物等多学科技术融合，有助于明确睡眠障碍的发生发展机制，推动神经调控技术干预睡眠障碍的理论创新和个体化诊疗技术创新。 3.3. 强化我国精神心理疾病领域国家临床医学研究中心的辐射带动作用 以国家临床医学研究中心为依托，以临床应用为导向，构建完整系统的大型中国睡眠障碍人群队列，持续跟踪随访，采集睡眠障碍患者神经影像、电生理、神经内分泌、分子遗传、蛋白组学、肠道微生物数据，结合动物实验，探索不同种类睡眠障碍的有效预测因素和疾病预测模型，提出睡眠障碍调控新理论，为我国睡眠障碍相关诊疗方案的制定提供基础与临床科学证据。 总之，睡眠障碍的防控研究是关系国民健康和国民经济的重要问题，目前我国在该领域的研究应用正加速发展。科研攻关方面，国家科技计划的支持力度不断提升，未来建议进一步增强该领域科研人才培养，注重与信息技术等多学科的交叉融合，以突破现有技术瓶颈；在临床实践方面，未来建议注重基层心理和行为干预领域的专业人员培养，缓解医患供需不平衡的问题，并进一步注重搭建智能化的分级诊疗平台，充分发挥人工智能等创新技术在医疗服务和健康管理等方面的优势。

              "content": "新华网北京3月25日电（记者 高方圆）日前，由中国睡眠研究会主办的2025年世界睡眠日中国主题发布会暨全国大型科普活动在京举办。据悉，今年世界睡眠日中国主题为“健康睡眠，优先之选”。会上，中国睡眠研究会发布了2025中国睡眠健康研究报告。 中国睡眠研究会调查表明，基于15万人以上的可穿戴数据显示，国民开始注重夜间睡眠时长，但仍爱熬夜。目前我国人群夜间平均睡眠时长为6.85小时，较去年增加6分钟。但入睡时间为00:18，较去年晚17分钟。国民午睡时长增加，72%的人群午睡时间超过30分钟，较去年增加9%。 近年来，越来越多的人因为睡眠问题而烦恼，一夜好眠成为大家的共同诉求。不同年龄段的人面临着不同的睡眠障碍，儿童、成人、老年人各自存在着不一样的睡眠问题。为此，新华网采访了来自不同医院科室的专家大夫，一起来听听他们针对不同群体睡眠问题的分析与建议。 在谈到儿童这一群体的健康睡眠时，北京儿童医院呼吸科主任医师、睡眠中心主任许志飞称，儿童的健康睡眠不仅要保证睡眠的时长要充足，还要有规律地入睡。不同年龄的人面临的睡眠疾病是不太一样的，大人打鼾，其实小朋友也存在打鼾的问题，一般是在3岁到8岁这个年龄段，如果出现了腺样体、扁桃体肥大，就会堵塞呼吸道，在睡觉时会憋气，憋气就会缺氧，导致深睡眠减少。没有深睡眠对大脑神经系统的发育会造成非常严重的伤害，心血管、内分泌、代谢等都会出现问题。因此，她建议，家长应该保证小朋友们拥有充足的、规律的睡眠，如果存在睡眠疾病，一定要及时就诊，给予治疗。 聚焦成年人睡眠障碍的主要原因，北京同仁医院耳鼻咽喉头颈外科副主任医师、副教授王小轶介绍，睡眠障碍是一个很大的范畴，它包括的睡眠疾病也很多，笼统上可以分为两大类，一个是外源性的，一个是内源性的。外源性的比如说我们去国外旅游或者是工作倒班，这些外界因素没有了，我们的睡眠障碍自然就消失了；还有一些内源性的因素，大家最关切的就是失眠，这是一大类，第二大类是睡眠呼吸暂停综合症，就是打鼾，这两个在老百姓生活中更容易体会到。 成年人睡眠障碍的成因大致如此，那么老年人的睡眠又存在哪些问题呢？上海交通大学医学院附属瑞金医院呼吸与危重症医学科主任李庆云进行了分析。他称，第一，老年人面临着刚开始步入退休生活的适应性变化，突然没事干了，就会思考一些问题，思前想后睡不着；第二，60岁到75岁身体健康的老年人和年轻人一样，也在适应快速的生活节奏，也在使用平面媒体获得娱乐；第三，老年人还会遇到慢性疾病的困扰，一些疾病本身就会影响睡眠。现在老年人还有一个新的问题，家庭子女的陪伴减少，导致他出现孤独感，这些都是睡眠障碍的原因。 不管哪个群体，都需要拥有高质量的睡眠以保证身体的健康。那么，如何改善和提高睡眠质量呢？吉林大学第一医院神经内科副主任、睡眠中心主任王赞给出的建议是，要有规律的作息，白天有光照，有合理的运动，合理的膳食。在生活习惯上，不建议下午喝咖啡或者睡前做运动，这样都会影响到睡眠的质量。另外，有的人睡眠质量不好，不是睡得少，可能是有其他的睡眠疾病，比如说打呼噜的人，没有深睡眠，所以睡眠质量还要看是不是合并了一些其他的睡眠问题，睡着以后的一些问题来积极解决。 北京大学人民医院睡眠医学科主任、北京大学睡眠研究中心主任韩芳，进一步阐述了高质量睡眠的要素。在他看来，高质量的睡眠需要调整很多不良的生活方式，另外，要注重人居环境。“为了让人们更好地睡眠，市场上出现了很多监测仪器，App可穿戴设备，还有睡眠保健品等，但是究竟管不管用，能不能弥补睡眠损失，这都是大家需要有清楚认识的。”韩芳说。 解放军总医院第二医学中心神经内科副主任技师高宇红则关注到了睡眠产业的发展前景。她称，睡眠相关的产品需求量越来越大，睡眠产业是一个阳光产业，AI可以与很多的个性化治疗或者是综合性治疗产生新的火花，这是人类所无法达到的。 最后，在推动睡眠产业高质量发展方面，王小轶再次强调，应该加强睡眠产业与科学的结合，针对不同人群应该有针对性地推出一些有助于睡眠的家居产品，加强临床研究与产业的结合，加强产学研成果的转化。",

              "content": "这篇文章深入探讨了在AI搜索时代，大学如何应对科研成果传播的机遇与挑战。AI搜索的兴起，以其主题化、摘要化的信息呈现方式，彻底改变了传统信息获取模式，为大学研究提供了突破传统传播壁巨大潜力，但同时也带来了“零点击搜索”和“信息茧房”等风险。文章强调，大学需积极调整内容策略，包括夯实传统SEO、优化“内容满意度信号”、构建清晰结构化的内容、深化主题权威性，以及利用主题集群和智能内部链接提升内容的深度和关联性。同时，大学应主动对抗信息茧房，提供多元视角。在伦理考量方面，文章呼吁关注AI摘要中的归因问题，平衡信息相关性与多元观点呈现，并强调维护学术公信力（E-E-A-T框架）。未来，大学可开发定制化AI工具，并教育学生和研究人员成为AI搜索的批判性用户和有效内容生产者。总结而言，大学需以创新和开放姿态，拥抱AI变革，履行作为知识灯塔的社会责任，确保高质量知识的有效传播。根据文章长度，预计阅读时间为5-8分钟。 引言：AI搜索时代的大学科研与信息传播 已完成部分： 当前，人工智能技术正以前所未有的速度重塑着各行各业，其中，信息获取方式的变革尤为引人注目。传统搜索引擎的霸主地位面临挑战，用户对更智能、更精准、更具对话性的信息获取体验需求日益增长。这种趋势不仅催生了AI搜索平台的蓬勃发展，更对作为知识生产和传播核心的大学提出了新的思考与挑战。如何在这个由AI驱动的信息时代，确保大学的科研成果能够被更广泛、更有效地触达，成为摆在所有学术机构面前的重要课题。 近期，宾夕法尼亚州立大学（2025USNews美国大学排名：63）能源、环境与食品经济学博士候选人Yuhui Jeong的一项研究为我们提供了一个有益的视角。她聚焦于商业有机废物禁令对马萨诸塞州住房市场环境和经济影响的深入分析，发现废物处理政策即便并非直接针对气味问题，也能显著提升当地环境质量并间接增加居民福利。这项研究的价值不仅在于其环境经济学意义，更在于其在新兴AI搜索语境下，如何实现更广泛传播的可能性。 简言之，在AI搜索日益普及的今天，大学的科研传播模式亟待升级。传统上，学术论文发表在专业期刊、通过研讨会宣讲，受众范围往往有限。然而，随着AI搜索技术，如Perplexity AI、Google Web Guide和ChatGPT Search的崛起，信息不再仅仅是“被找到”，而是“被发现”并以主题化、摘要化的形式呈现给用户。这些AI搜索工具通过复杂的“查询扇出”（Query Fan-Out）机制，将用户的宽泛查询拆解为多个子查询，并整合来自海量源头的信息，最终生成高度关联且易于理解的答案。例如，用户搜索“有机废物处理政策的经济影响”，AI搜索或许会直接呈现Yuhui Jeong研究的核心结论，甚至链接到其论文中的关键段落。这无疑为大学研究提供了一个突破传统传播壁垒、触达更广泛非专业受众的巨大机遇。 细想起来，AI在各个领域的快速发展已成为不争的事实。“AI视频生成器”、“AI代理”、“AI教师辅助工具”等关键词在搜索榜单上持续走高，无不昭示着AI对效率和个性化需求的深度满足。用户对信息获取方式的期待也在随之改变，他们倾向于即时、整合、无需多次点击便能获得“终极答案”的体验。Statista的数据也印证了这一点：全球AI搜索访问量预计将在2028年超越传统搜索，美国已有数百万用户将AI搜索作为首选工具进行探索和消费研究。这一趋势要求大学不仅要关注科研内容本身，更要思考如何以AI友好的方式封装和呈现这些知识，使其能在AI搜索的“新赛道”上获得更高的可见度和影响力。否则，再有价值的学术发现，也可能在信息的洪流中被淹没，无法发挥其应有的社会价值。 AI驱动的搜索范式转变：机遇与潜在风险 本小编认为，AI驱动的搜索范式转变，正是当下我们需要重点审视的核心议题。首先，我们不妨深入了解AI搜索的核心机制，它们是如何构建并呈现我们所见到的“答案”的。 以Google为例，其“查询扇出”（Query Fan-Out）技术和“主题搜索”专利，正是AI搜索引擎精髓的体现。当用户提交一个看似简单的查询时，例如“商业有机废物禁令对社区的影响”，传统的搜索引擎可能会返回一堆相关的网页链接。但AI搜索，特别是Google的AI模式和Gemini，会运用先进的自然语言处理（NLP）技术，将这个复杂查询拆解成一系列更具体的子查询。简言之，它会像一个勤奋的研究助理，围绕原始查询展开多维度探索，例如：这项禁令具体包含了哪些规定？它是在哪个地区实施的？有哪些环境效益？对当地经济，特别是房地产市场产生了什么影响？ 这些子查询会并行在海量数据源中执行，包括传统的网页索引、专业数据库、Google知识图谱，甚至其他大型语言模型（LLMs）。最终，AI系统会综合评估这些分散的结果，并运用其强大的文本生成能力，提炼出主题化的摘要。这些摘要不仅仅是简单地聚合信息，更是通过对内容的理解和关联，将零散的知识点组织成连贯、易懂的回答。以Yuhui Jeong的研究为例，AI搜索可能不仅会直接呈现其关于马萨诸塞州住房价格上涨的结论，甚至会将这一发现置于更广泛的城市规划、环境政策或社区福利改善的语境中进行概括，帮助用户在无需点击多个链接的情况下，迅速把握研究的核心要义。这种“答案即展示”的模式，无疑极大地提高了信息获取的效率。 其次，这种机制的转变也对我们内容策略产生了深远影响。传统SEO（搜索引擎优化）侧重于关键词密度和链接建设，但在AI搜索时代，重点已悄然转向“主题权威性”。AI不再仅仅匹配孤立的关键词，而是试图理解内容的整体主题、深度和广度。一份围绕特定主题提供全面、深入、多维度信息的文章，将更有可能被AI系统识别为“权威来源”，并在主题化摘要中被引用。例如，Yuhui Jeong的研究，因其对特定政策的全面剖析和因果关系的严谨论证，即便其论文并非广泛流行，也可能在AI搜索中获得高度关注，因为AI会将其视为该主题领域的深度洞察。 然而，随之而来的挑战也不容忽视，其中最突出的是“零点击搜索”行为的增加。当AI直接在搜索结果页面提供完整答案时，用户可能不再需要点击进入原始网页，这无疑会减少网站的直接流量。这对于大学机构而言，意味着需要重新评估其内容营销和传播目标。此外，AI搜索的崛起，尤其是其偏好提供高度“相关性”答案的算法，也带来了一个潜在风险：加剧“信息茧房”效应。研究表明，搜索工具若过度优化于“相关性”，可能会使用户更倾向于搜索并接触那些与自身已有信念相符的信息，从而限制他们接触多元观点的机会。宾夕法尼亚州立大学Yuhui Jeong的研究成果，虽然其本身具有客观性，但在AI概括时，也可能因算法的倾向性，在不同用户的搜索结果中被赋予不同的“解读语境”，甚至在极少数情况下，出现误导性信息（hallucinations）的挑战。AI的这一缺陷，要求我们在享受其便利的同时，始终保持批判性思维。 更进一步细想，宾夕法尼亚州立大学Yuhui Jeong的研究在AI搜索时代面临双重境遇。一方面，AI搜索通过其强大的概括和主题化能力，能够帮助其研究成果在更广阔的语境中被发现和理解。例如，一位关注城市环境政策的决策者，通过AI搜索，可能在众多相关信息中迅速定位到Yuhui Jeong关于废物禁令对环境质量和房价影响的具体数据和结论，这无疑扩大了研究的影响力。另一方面，我们也要警惕AI概括可能带来的信息失真。AI在提炼复杂学术研究时，为了简洁易懂，可能会简化某些前提条件、限定范围或研究细节，从而导致信息的偏差。因此，如何在AI呈现的研究摘要中，既保持内容的权威性和准确性，又能够吸引用户进一步探究原文，是大学传播者必须面对的课题。 大学在AI搜索时代的内容策略：提升可见性与公信力 本小编认为，面对AI搜索带来的新范式，大学和学术机构必须采取积极主动、多维度的内容策略，以提升其科研成果的可见性与公信力。 首先，夯实传统SEO基础至关重要。即便AI搜索日益普及，但其底层逻辑依然依赖于对网络内容的抓取和理解。因此，优化关键词、提升页面速度、确保移动端友好以及构建合理的内部链接结构，这些“基本功”仍是不可或缺的。例如，当Yuhui Jeong的研究发布时，其官方页面应确保包含与“商业有机废物禁令”、“马萨诸塞州住房市场”、“环境经济学”等相关的精准关键词，并优化页面加载速度，保证在手机等移动设备上的良好阅读体验。同时，通过将研究链接到大学相关院系、研究所甚至其他相关研究的页面，能够构建一个逻辑严密的内部链接网络，既方便用户深入了解，也有利于AI工具更好地爬取和理解内容结构。 其次，要着重优化“内容满意度信号”。AI搜索引擎高度重视用户与内容的互动反馈。如果用户在AI生成的摘要后，点击进入网页却迅速跳出，这会向AI发出负面信号。因此，大学内容必须确保能即时提供价值。笔者的建议是： * 核心答案前置：将研究最重要、最吸引人的结论和发现置于内容开篇，如同新闻报道的“倒金字塔”结构，让用户和AI在最短时间内获取关键信息。 * 使用短句和清晰的格式：学术内容往往专业性强，但为了适应AI的抓取和用户的快速浏览，应尽量使用简洁明了的语言，避免冗长复杂的句子。通过合理运用小标题、列表、加粗等格式，提高内容的可读性和可扫描性。 * 辅以图表和案例：研究成果，特别是数据分析，可以通过高质量的图表、信息图和具体案例来辅助解释，这不仅能提升用户体验，也为AI提供了更多可结构化抓取的信息片段。例如，Yuhui Jeong的研究若能辅以马萨诸塞州住房价格波动图或前后对比案例，将更具说服力。 再次，构建“清晰、结构化的内容”以适应AI工具对单个内容片段的抓取和总结是关键。AI搜索引擎不再仅仅返回整个网页，而是能够抓取和总结网页中的特定段落或信息点。 * 逻辑性标题：使用逻辑严密、层次分明的小标题，能够清晰界定每个段落的主题，方便AI理解内容结构。 * 倒金字塔结构：不仅体现在整篇文章，每个段落内部也应遵循倒金字塔结构，即先提出核心观点，再展开具体论证和细节。这使得AI更容易识别和提取关键信息。 第四，深化主题而非泛化。在AI搜索时代，建立“主题权威性”远比追求内容的广度更重要。大学研究者和传播者应聚焦于其专业领域的特定主题，进行深入、全面的探讨，而非泛泛而谈。例如，Yuhui Jeong专注于“商业有机废物禁令对住房市场的影响”，这种高度专业化的研究更容易被AI识别为该领域的权威信息源。大学应鼓励研究者将第一手经验、专业知识与深入的用户意图理解相结合，提供全面且无冗余的答案，从而在特定主题领域建立不可撼动的专业地位。 第五，构建“主题集群和智能内部链接”来提升内容的深度和关联性。大学的网站通常拥有海量的研究成果和专业知识，通过主题集群可以更好地组织这些内容。 * 中心页面（Pillar Page）：围绕一个宽泛的核心主题，如“环境政策与可持续发展”，创建一个全面的中心页面。 * 集群页面（Cluster Pages）：围绕中心主题下的具体细分领域，创建多个深入的集群页面，例如Yuhui Jeong的“商业有机废物禁令”就可以成为一个集群页面，或其研究下再细分“政策实施机制”、“长期环境效益”、“房地产市场传导效应”等子集群。 * 智能内部链接：利用描述性锚文本将中心页面与所有集群页面、以及集群页面之间进行相互链接。这不仅有助于用户在不同主题间无缝跳转，更重要的是，它向搜索引擎和AI系统清晰地表明了内容的深度、广度以及不同主题间的逻辑关联，从而强化了大学在特定主题领域的整体权威性。Backlinko的案例表明，通过主题集群和智能内链，网站可以显著提升其在AI搜索中的可见性。 最后，大学应借鉴PNAS研究中的算法干预经验，主动对抗信息茧房。PNAS的研究揭示，过度追求“相关性”的搜索算法可能加剧确认偏误。大学作为知识的灯塔和多元视角的倡导者，有责任通过内容策略来抵制这一趋势。 * 主动提供多元视角的内容：在发布研究成果时，大学传播者可以考虑如何主动呈现与该研究相关的不同观点、政策辩论或潜在的局限性。例如，在介绍Yuhui Jeong研究时，除了强调其积极发现，也可以提及围绕废物禁令可能存在的其他经济或社会考量，或指出不同地区政策效果的差异。 * 设计“拓展搜索”选项：大学可以在其内容页面或内部搜索工具中，尝试设计类似于PNAS研究中“Search Broadly”的选项。通过主动推荐相关但视角不同的文章、研究或专家观点，鼓励用户跳出原有搜索习惯，接触更广泛的信息，从而促进更全面的认知和信念更新。这种“算法干预”并非操控，而是以人为本，旨在培养用户的批判性思维和多元信息获取能力，最终提升大学作为公共知识提供者的社会责任感和公信力。 AI搜索对学术研究传播的伦理考量与未来展望 AI搜索对学术传播的影响远不止于内容呈现和可见性，其所衍生的伦理挑战与未来发展，是大学必须审慎面对的深层议题。 首先，AI生成摘要和答案中的“归因”与“引用”问题，构成了对学术作品原创性和完整性的核心挑战。当AI搜索引擎直接生成综合性答案时，如果缺乏清晰、准确的来源归属，将极大地损害原创研究者的权益。本小编认为，这要求AI开发者和学术界共同探索更完善的归因机制，确保每一次引用都能溯源至原始作者和出版物，并提供可点击的链接。大学作为知识产权的守护者，应积极倡导在AI环境中对学术原创性的尊重，并通过技术手段（如嵌入数字水印、区块链验证等）来保护其研究成果不被剽窃或错误归因。 其次，审视AI搜索在传播科学研究时，如何平衡信息相关性与多元观点呈现，避免偏见放大，是另一个重要的伦理维度。以Yuhui Jeong的环境政策研究为例，如果AI搜索过度强调其积极结论，而忽略了可能存在的政策争议、实施挑战或不同利益群体的观点，就可能无意中放大单一叙事，加剧“信息茧房”效应。笔者认为，大学应主动在其科研传播中融入批判性视角，例如在介绍研究成果时，提供对潜在局限性、未来研究方向或不同政策路径的讨论。同时，可探索与AI公司合作，开发算法，在提供高相关性信息的同时，策略性地引入多元化的相关观点，引导用户进行更全面的思考。 再者，大学作为知识生产者，在AI时代维护学术公信力至关重要。E-E-A-T（专业性、经验、权威性、可信赖性）框架为大学提升内容质量提供了指南。这意味着大学应： * 展现专业性（Expertise）：确保所有发布内容的科学严谨性，引用权威来源，并由相关领域的专家进行审核。 * 彰显经验（Experience）：通过案例研究、实地调研、实验数据等，展示研究的实践基础和实际影响。Yuhui Jeong对马萨诸塞州真实政策的分析就是极佳的经验体现。 * 建立权威性（Authoritativeness）：积极推动研究者在专业领域发声，参与政策制定和公共讨论，提升机构在特定议题上的权威地位。 * 增强可信赖性（Trustworthiness）：维护学术诚信，确保数据透明可验证，并及时纠正错误信息，构建与公众的信任关系。 展望未来，大学如何与AI技术更紧密地结合，开发定制化的AI工具或平台，以更高效、准确地传播科研成果，将成为其核心竞争力之一。不妨一看： * 定制化AI摘要工具：大学可利用AI开发内部工具，为不同受众群体（如政策制定者、学生、普通公众）生成定制化的研究摘要，既保持学术严谨性，又易于理解。 * 跨学科知识整合与可视化平台：利用AI进行大数据分析和自然语言处理，整合不同学科的研究成果，并通过AI可视化技术，将复杂的跨学科知识以直观、互动的方式呈现，促进新发现。 * AI辅助的学术推荐系统：开发智能推荐系统，根据用户的研究兴趣和阅读历史，精准推送相关学术论文和专家观点，提升知识发现效率。 最后，大学应教育学生和研究人员，使其成为AI搜索的批判性用户和有效内容生产者。信息过载和虚假信息是AI时代面临的共同挑战。大学需开设相关课程，培养学生的数字素养和批判性思维，教授他们如何辨别AI生成信息的真伪、评估信息来源的可靠性，并理解算法偏见。同时，也应指导研究人员如何以AI友好的方式撰写和发布内容，例如学习提示工程（prompt engineering）技巧，以便他们的研究成果能被AI系统更准确地理解和传播。简言之，培养一批既能驾驭AI工具，又能对其保持警惕的新一代学者，是大学不可推卸的责任。 结论：大学在AI搜索浪潮中的角色与责任 简言之，AI搜索带来的变革是大学科研传播绕不开的时代命题。大学必须认识到，这不仅是挑战，更是前所未有的机遇，能够让知识的灯塔在数字化浪潮中焕发更璀璨的光芒。我们看到，零点击行为和信息茧房的风险固然存在，但AI搜索也为大学提供了更精准、高效地传播知识的可能性。因此，大学需主动适应，不仅要持续优化传统SEO策略，更要拥抱AI友好型内容结构，确保研究成果以主题化、结构化的方式呈现，从而被AI工具准确捕捉和推广。同时，大学应积极参与AI搜索技术的伦理构建与应用，保障学术信息的透明、公正与有效传播，确保归因清晰、观点多元。未来，大学将继续肩负其作为知识灯塔的社会责任，以创新精神和开放态度，引导公众获取高质量、多视角的知识，持续赋能社会进步。

原创性与完整性受损：当AI搜索引擎直接生成综合性答案，如果缺乏清晰、准确的来源归属，将极大地损害原创研究者的权益。用户可能直接获取AI提供的“终极答案”而不再追溯原始文献，导致研究成果的原始作者和出版物得不到应有的识别和认可。 - 溯源困难：AI生成的摘要和答案往往整合了来自海量源头的信息，这使得用户难以辨别具体的信息来源于哪一篇论文、哪一位作者。如果AI系统不能提供可点击的、明确的引用链接，那么学术作品的溯源性就会大打折扣。 - 潜在的剽窃风险：虽然AI的初衷并非剽窃，但如果其内容生成机制未能充分考虑到版权和归因问题，可能会无意中产生与原创内容高度相似却缺乏明确引用的文本，这在学术界被视为剽窃行为。 - 激励机制的削弱：对于致力于原创研究的学者而言，其研究成果如果不能得到适当的归因和引用，可能会降低他们进行深入研究的动力和热情，因为他们的知识贡献没有得到充分的认可。 为应对这些挑战，文章建议AI开发者和学术界共同探索更完善的归因机制，确保每一次引用都能溯源至原始作者和出版物，并提供可点击的链接。大学作为知识产权的守护者，应积极倡导在AI环境中对学术原创性的尊重，并通过技术手段（如嵌入数字水印、区块链验证等）来保护其研究成果不被剽窃或错误归因。 问题4: 大学如何利用E-E-A-T框架在AI时代维护并提升其学术公信力？ 大学在AI时代维护并提升学术公信力，可以有效借鉴E-E-A-T（Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness，即专业性、经验、权威性、可信赖性）框架。具体措施如下： - 展现专业性（Expertise）：大学应确保所有发布内容的科学严谨性，所有研究成果都应经过严格的同行评审和专家审核。在传播科研成果时，应引用权威来源，并由相关领域的资深专家撰写或把关。例如，宾夕法尼亚州立大学能源、环境与食品经济学博士候选人Yuhui Jeong的研究，因其聚焦于特定领域的深度分析，本身就体现了高度的专业性。 -

              "content": "去中心化临床试验中的供应商合规管理（上） 去中心化临床试验中的供应商合规管理（上） 远程智能临床试验或去中心化临床试验（decentralized clinical trials，DCT）是一种贯彻“以患者为中心\"理念的新型临床试验模式，在我国已经初步落地并逐步形成了可推广的运行管理方式。DCT具备改善受试者可及性和便利性、提高临床研究质量与效率、降低研究成本等特点[1]。国家药品监督管理局药品审评中心（以下简称“药审中心\"）于2023年7月27日正式发布并施行《以患者为中心的药物临床试验设计技术指导原则（试行）》《以患者为中心的药物临床试验实施技术指导原则（试行）》《以患者为中心的药物获益-风险评估技术指导原则（试行）》（以下统称“DCT指导原则\"）。DCT指导原则系统阐述了如何在临床试验中体现“以患者为中心\"的理念，勾勒了各方协作构建更符合患者需求的临床试验活动生态场景，将对指导DCT在我国实践产生积极影响。 DCT的实施是在数字场景下利用远程智能技术手段，对传统的受试者招募、知情同意、试验用药品管理、受试者访视、实验室检测、试验记录和数据管理、质量控制等环节进行革新。这其中离不开各环节新技术服务供应商的参与。然而，采用新方法、新模式开展临床试验依然要保证药物临床试验过程规范，数据和结果科学、真实、可靠，以保护受试者的权益和安全。如何缓解追求新型临床试验设计目标（包括对患者更加可及、友好、便利等）与恪守临床试验传统监管要求之间可能的“紧张\"关系，如何找准DCT模式中的新生监管靶点，如何积极防范远程智能技术供应商参与DCT带来的合规风险，成为药品监管部门、申办者、研究者、临床试验机构等各方须共同携手应对的新课题。 一、DCT供应商合规管理的必要性 （一）DCT供应商合规是新型临床试验质量控制的关键环节 DCT之所以得以实现，是因为传统的患者招募、知情同意、试验用药品的供给和管理、访视、监查、受试者补偿等环节都可以借助远程智能技术服务供应商的力量由传统的现场临床试验转变为场景可选的新型临床试验模式。《药物临床试验质量管理规范》（GCP）第三十一条要求申办者基于风险进行质量管理，从供应商、计算机化系统、标准操作规程等系统层面识别影响临床试验关键环节和数据的风险。在智能化临床研究中，如何评价开发系统的企业资质也是推进智能化临床研究的关键点之一[2]。因此，充分认识到DCT供应商的加入对传统临床试验生态体系的重构，进而识别并控制DCT供应商在实施各项临床试验职责中的合法合规性风险是申办者开展临床试验质量管理的重要内容。 一方面，DCT供应商是否熟悉相关法律法规和GCP的要求成为影响临床试验质量的重要问题。临床试验的质量管理是临床试验的核心内容，直接关系到试验数据的真实性、试验结果的可靠度[3]。DCT供应商受托实施各项临床试验任务，应当实施质量保证和质量控制，否则临床试验各参与方的合规问题最终会传导，进而影响临床试验的合规。例如，在DCT患者招募供应商未能对受试者个人信息进行一定程度去标识化处理时，将可能导致受试者隐私泄露，数据安全失控；未能建立药物全流程质量控制（包括取药、发药、药物运输、药物签收、药物服用要求、受试者服药依从性跟进、药物返还等环节）时，将使得药物直达患者（direct to patient，DTP）环节不合规；采用电子化临床结局评估（electronic clinical outcome assessment，eCOA）收集患者体验数据时不能保证受试者填报电子日志后无法修改，将使得eCOA数据真实性和准确性存疑等。 另一方面，申办者的临床试验的质量管理体系应当覆盖临床试验的全过程，包括临床试验的设计、实施、记录等环节。随着临床试验参与方的增多，申办者应当将供应商管理纳入临床试验质量管理体系，否则申办者的质量保证和质量控制便无法保证。当申办者经评估认为可采用远程知情同意、远程访视、DTP等新模式开展临床试验时，申办者应当在临床试验项目启动前对相关拟参与的供应商开展合法合规性尽职调查，并根据调查结果和规范性要求完善申办者与供应商签署的合同，还需针对供应商开展“全链条\"和“全生命周期\"合规管理，以确保临床试验质量，预防潜在风险，保障试验过程的合规。 提前识别并控制供应商潜在风险同样体现在ICH《E6（R3）：药物临床试验质量管理规范》（原则及附件1草案）中，其规定应确定试验质量的关键因素（即关键数据和流程）以及影响这些关键因素完整性并最终影响试验结果可靠性的风险因素。DCT供应商本身资质的违法违规以及受托实施临床试验职责的不当履约行为均可能构成影响临床试验质量的潜在风险。因此，对DCT供应商进行合规管理是新型临床试验质量管理的重要内容。 （二）DCT供应商合规是启动药品注册核查考虑的潜在风险因素 2022年1月1日起实施的《药品注册核查检验启动工作程序（试行）》（以下简称“《启动工作程序》\"）对参与药学研制、临床试验、药理毒理学研究以及生产制造的相关单位和机构，即“全链条\"研发生产主体及药物研发“全生命周期\"合规风险提出核查要求，明确了启动药品注册核查的对象、启动药品注册核查的风险考虑因素、核查原则和程序等问题[4]。启动药品注册核查考虑的风险因素之一是研发生产主体合规因素，诸如，研发生产主体的风险等级、既往接受核查情况及重大不合规问题等。药审中心在临床试验和药学研制与生产中重点关注的重大不合规问题包括质量管理体系是否合规，受试者权益是否得到有效保障，临床试验或研发数据的真实性、可靠性及完整性是否存疑，法规依从性是否得到保证等。 具体到DCT中，临床试验质量管理同样存在常见的合规问题，包括：eCOA采集的临床试验记录不符合逻辑；伦理委员会未对DCT修订方案及电子知情同意内容进行审查；试验用药品部分原始记录不完整；不良事件判断不合理、描述不规范、记录不及时；电子支付未能保护受试者个人信息等。申办者是临床试验数据质量和可靠性的最终责任人，当申办者将临床试验部分或全部工作委托给从事DCT的供应商时，若受托主体自身受到有因检查或发生重大不合规问题，以及因其他不合规因素触发药品注册核查，不仅申办者的药品注册申请将受到影响，而且申办者自身的合法合规信用也可能受到挑战和质疑。因此，申办者应当在与各供应商的协议中明确定义临床试验的职责、分工并适当地记录。对于委托给各供应商的工作和任务，申办者应对上述活动进行必要的监督。 二、DCT供应商合规管理面临的主要问题 （一）DCT供应商合规风险不明确 DCT涉及的服务供应商众多，包括远程访视服务供应商、远程知情同意服务供应商、智能招募服务供应商、远程监查服务供应商、DTP服务供应商、电子支付服务供应商、eCOA服务供应商、呼叫中心服务供应商等。根据《药品管理法》《疫苗管理法》《药品管理法实施条例》以及GCP的有关规定，上述供应商在提供DCT服务过程中面临的合法合规性义务不尽相同。目前，因不同供应商的合规问题导致的药物临床试验质量出现的问题尚无明确统一的梳理和界定，这使得药品监管部门、申办者、研究者、临床试验机构等各方缺乏监管或是风险控制抓手，更阻碍了DCT体系的建设进程。 （二）DCT供应商合规自律尚无制度化要求 目前，DCT服务供应商数量呈逐年上升的趋势，这也从侧面反映出DCT模式对于提升临床试验效率、促进药物研发成效显著。由于DCT等新型临床试验模式尚处于试点探索初期，各相关方对于何为科学规范、可推广的DCT运行管理和监管模式尚无定论。例如，对于DCT供应商，监管部门或行业组织尚无固定的合规监管计划安排，在重点领域和关键环节判定、风险识别以及重点检查范围划定等方面也无常态化要求。因此，无论是内部还是外部，DCT供应商行业都尚未建立并运行成熟的质量管理体系，严格实施标准操作规程，及时研判并适应外部法律政策环境等，这可能会给DCT未来的成熟发展带来风险。 （三）DCT供应商行业合规建设尚未形成 一是法律法规尚不健全。针对远程智能技术服务供应商，尚未出台供应商管理的规范性文件，包括数据供应商质量管理规范（质控体系）、对供应商的招采信用评价制度等。二是行业监管缺位。以“可靠性、可控性和安全性\"为核心的市场准入与退出门槛不明确；对失信和违约行为的惩戒措施与法律责任不明确等。三是行业自律不充分。具有公信力的官方组织或社会团体尚未承担开展社会评级的职能，可供业内公开使用的信用评价成果缺乏；从业人员准入资格标准缺乏；未能定期对从业人员进行充分的网络安全、数据安全以及个人信息保护制度培训；未能定期对从业人员进行职业道德教育；“合规从业、维护安全、良性竞争\"的从业氛围不够浓厚等。 三、DCT供应商合规管理要求 DCT供应商作为临床试验项目的参与方，应当实施质量保证和质量控制，以及接受申办者对外包工作的监管。DCT的出现和发展必然会改变或拓展“试验现场（实施临床试验相关活动的场所）\"的概念，未来临床试验的发生地很可能是多个空间场所的组合[5]。虽然，临床试验的多方利益相关者目标一致，均是以患者为中心，为患者提供好药并增加可及性，但开展数字化临床试验应谨慎，须关注安全性和数据可靠性[6]。为了保证药物临床试验过程规范，数据和结果的科学、真实、可靠，保护受试者的权益和安全，DCT供应商需遵守的合规管理要求包含共性要求和特殊要求两个方面。 （一）DCT供应商合规管理共性要求 根据GCP对临床试验活动，尤其是试验管理、数据处理与记录保存环节符合试验方案、标准操作规程和相关法律法规的总体要求，DCT供应商应当恰当、真实、完整记录DCT服务过程中所产生的数据并保证可溯源。药物临床试验数据是否真实可靠，决定了上市药品的安全性和有效性[7]；与研究机构或研究者协商确定DCT系统的源数据、源文件，供申办者进行监查和稽查，以及供药品监管部门进行检查；实施数据安全和隐私保护措施，包括但不限于数据加密、身份验证和授权控制，以保护受试者的隐私和数据的安全；提供安全的数据传输和存储解决方案，以保护受试者的隐私和试验数据的完整性；在数据收集、使用、传输和存储过程中实施严格的数据脱敏和加密措施，以确保受试者个人信息权益和隐私权得到良好保护。DCT并不是复制或取代传统临床试验，临床试验的独特性与复杂性决定了每一项试验在方案设计上要做到平衡传统临床试验与DCT元素，都需要根据试验的具体情况考量决定[8]。 （二）DCT供应商合规管理特殊要求 1. 远程访视服务供应商职责 采取相应手段确认每次参加访视人员为受试者本人；提供清晰、稳定、实时的视频和音频通讯服务，使研究者和受试者能够进行有效的远程交流；提供可记录和回放的视频会议功能，便于记录访视过程，以确保试验的完整性和质量；确保访视原始数据的有效保存及可溯源。 2. 远程知情同意服务供应商职责 提供电子签名和文档管理系统，以便受试者能够远程阅读和签署知情同意书；避免不熟悉电子方式的受试者（包括老年人群等）的权益受损；为研究者和受试者提供知情同意过程的视频连线和在线提问答疑服务，以确保受试者充分理解试验的目的、程序和潜在风险。 3. 智能招募服务供应商职责 合规获取潜在受试者个人信息；提供与医疗机构的系统集成解决方案，以便在医疗机构的数据库中进行初步的受试者筛选。 4. 远程监查服务供应商职责 保证远程监查中的数据安全；提供安全、可靠的远程监查平台，以便研究者和监查人员能够实时访问和审核试验数据。 5. DTP服务供应商职责 提供安全、可靠、及时的药物配送服务，确保受试者能够按照临床试验的要求接收到药物；提供符合法规要求的药物储存和管理服务，包括但不限于药物的接收、存储、分发和退还等；对于需要在特定温度条件下运输和储存的药物，应提供可靠的温度控制和监控解决方案。 6. 电子支付服务供应商职责 提供快速、准确的支付处理服务，确保受试者和其他相关方能够及时接收到相应的补偿；设计并实施有效的支付审核和验证流程，以防止错误支付和欺诈活动。 7. eCOA服务供应商职责 提供可靠、易用的eCOA平台，使受试者和研究人员能够便捷、准确地记录和提交临床结局数据；实施合法有效的数据收集和处理流程，确保临床结局数据的准确性和完整性。 8. 呼叫中心服务供应商 提供全天候的电话支持服务，以便记录和向研究者及时传达受试者的问题和情况；提供紧急联系服务，以便在必要时为受试者提供及时的支持和援助。 下篇预告 我们将在本文的下篇继续围绕DCT供应商合规管理，提出完善管理与评估的措施，并建议强化法律法规体系、政府监管和行业自律建设，以构建稳固的合规管理基础。 [参考文献] [1] 潘军华, 景新颖, 李晓峰, 等.北京自由贸易试验区建设背景下开展去中心化临床试验的思考及建议[J].中国食品药品监管,2022(6):114-119.

（五）各省和中心城市要在发布人工成本信息后10日内，将发布的有关信息按一式3份分别报我部劳动工资司和规划财务司。 附件：行业人工成本信息指导制度实施办法 二○○四年十二月六日 附件 行业人工成本信息指导制度实施办法 为了规范行业人工成本信息指导制度建设工作的开展，特制定本办法： 一、制定调查方案 调查方案包括确定调查行业和企业范围、调查内容、调查对象和调查方法以及制作调查表等。 （一）调查范围和内容 调查范围：调查城市行政区域内的生产经营正常的独立核算企业。 调查内容：人工成本总额（包括从业人员劳动报酬总额、社会保险费用、福利费用、教育费用、劳动保护费用、住房费用和其他人工成本共七个构成部分）、企业从业人员平均人数（包括在岗职工人数）、企业增加值、企业销售收入、企业利润总额、企业成本（费用）总额。 （二）调查对象和方法 一般采取抽样调查方法或典型调查方法。根据以下要求分别确定调查行业、调查企业、调查职业（工种）。 调查行业、企业：在19个大行业中，调查一般以制造业为重点，并可根据实际情况对行业进行细化。调查企业按抽样方法在有关行业中分别抽取不少于三分之一的生产经营正常的独立核算的企业进行调查。每个中心城市按抽样调查方法抽取不少于1/3的生产经营正常的独立核算企业填报。有关中央单位及企业集团抽取一定数量生产经营正常、有代表性的独立核算企业填报。确定调查企业要兼顾企业经济类型和规模。 调查职业（工种）：制定发布企业职位人工成本水平的，要根据当地产业结构的特点来确定，特别注重选择通用的或市场上流动性较强的职业（工种）。职业的名称、代码要按照《中华人民共和国职业分类大典》和我部编制的《劳动力市场职业分类与代码》进行规范，保证职业分类的统一化和标准化。 二、实施调查 数据的采集是制度建设的重要基础工作。为了保证统计调查的规范和统一，在确定的调查企业中，各地要严格按照我部劳动保障统计报表制度中的《企业人工成本调查表》的要求进行调查，采集有关数据。调查应按制度规定的时间完成，并按要求上报我部规划财务司。收集的数据资料应准确、真实，具有代表性和可比性。 三、汇总分析有关数据、资料 行业人工成本信息要在对有关数据资料进行科学的整理和分析的基础上制定。严格按照《行业人工成本调查和分析方法》的要求，对数据进行调查统计、汇总分析，以保证行业人工成本在不同地区之间具有可比性。主要分析指标及计算方法如下： 指标主要分为人工成本水平指标、人工成本结构指标、人工成本投入产出指标以及人工成本指数指标四类。 （一）水平指标 1、人均人工成本（计量单位：千元、元） 人均人工成本是企业全部人工成本支出[FS:PAGE]平均分摊到每一名从业人员的份额。可以细化为人均年、月和小时人工成本，人均月、小时人工成本应按年人均人工成本指标进行折算，是国际间进行横向比较的常用指标。 年人均人工成本=年人工成本总额年从业人员平均人数 月人均人工成本=年人均人工成本12 小时人工成本=年人均人工成本年人均实际工作时数 企业从业人员年人均实际工作时数是指企业从业人员实际发生的年人均实际工时。其额度是按国家和企业内部规定平均每人每年的制度工作时数和加班工作时数之和减去非正常工作工时损耗。 2、职位人工成本 职位人工成本是企业在一定时期内对某一类职位从业人员直接和间接支出的平均人工成本指标，据此反映企业在一定时期内（一般为一年，也可以是月、小时）因使用某一类人员所发生的全部人工成本，同时反映这一类人员在一定时期内获得的总体报酬水平。 （二）结构指标 1、人工成本分项结构比例（计量单位：%） 人工成本分项结构比例是企业支出的全部人工成本中的七大构成项目各自占有的比例。它可以反映企业人工成本支出的总体结构以及各个构成部分的变动状况和优化程度。 某项人工成本构成比例=某个人工成本项目总额企业人工成本总额× 100% 2、人工成本相当总成本（费用）的比例（计量单位：%） 人工成本相当于总成本（费用）的比例=企业人工成本总额企业成本（费用）总额× 100% （三）水平指数 人工成本水平指数是指当期人均人工成本（年度、月、小时人工成本）、职位人工成本与基期的对比关系。该指标 以定比或环比形式反映一定时期内人工成本水平的升降幅度。 1、年度人均人工成本环比指数 年度人均人工成本环比指数是指报告年度人均人工成本水平与上一年度人均人工成本水平之间的比值。 年度人均人工成本环比指数=报告年度人均人工成本上一年度人均人工成本× 100 2、年度人均人工成本定比指数 年度人均人工成本定比指数是指报告年度人均人工成本水平与某一基期年度人均人工成本水平之间的比值。 年度人均人工成本定比指数=报告期年度人均人工成本某一基期年度人均人工成本× 100 月人均人工成本环比指数、月人均人工成本定比指数、小时人均人工成本环比指数以及小时人均人工成本定比指 数可参照上述公式的方法进行计算。 （四）人工成本分析的投入产出指标 1、劳动分配率（计量单位：%） 劳动分配率是指人工成本占增加值（纯收入）比重。它是集中反映企业人工成本投入产出水平的指标，也是衡量企业人工成本相对水平高低程度的重要指标。 劳动分配率= 人工成本总额增加值（纯收入）×100% 2、人事费用率（计量单位：%） 人事费用率指人工成本占销售收入（营业收入）比重。该指标反应了人工成本的投入产出比例、从业人员报酬在企业总收入中的份额以及从业人员报酬与劳动生产率的对比关系。 人事费用率=人工成本总额销售收入×100% 3、人工成本利润率（计量单位：%） 人工成本利润率是指企业投入的人工成本代价与企业最终获得的以利润表现的经济效益之间的关系。该指标表明，在企业新创造价值当中，从业人员直接和间接得到的全部报酬与企业利润之间的关系。在同行业企业中，人工成本利润率越高，表明单位人工成本支出所取得的经济效益越好，人工成本的相对水平越低。 人工成本利润率=利润总额人工成本总额× 100% 四、人工成本提示、预警和预测方法 （一）人工成本的提示 人工成本提示是政府在发布的信息中对有关人工成本指标高于行业平均水平一定幅度的企业进行提醒，使企业关注其竞争力。主要内容包括： 1、提示指标的调查样本总量。 2、企业指标在样本总量中的排名位置。 3、调查指标样本统计数值。 ①高位数；②中位数；③低位数。 4、企业指标偏离值。 ①与高位数±相差的绝对数和百分比；②与中位数±相差的绝对数和百分比；③与低位数±相差的绝对数和百分比。 （二）人工成本的预警 人工成本预警是对人工成本指标过高的企业以警示，使企业了解其人工成本水平可能已对企业竞争力产生严重的不利影响。主要内容包括： 1、投入产出指标预警 当企业的人工成本利润率或人事费用率与全国（或本地区）同行业同类指标众数的偏离值达到30%以上（各城市根据自己的情况进行调整），即可提出预警。 2、水平指标预警 当企业的“小时人工成本”过高，表示总体人工成本水平过高或劳动时间组织不合理；某些“职位人工成本”过高或过低，表示人工成本配置不合理。 两个指标过高的评价标准是：与全国（或本地区）同行业同期指标的众数偏离值达到30%以上（各城市可根据当地的情况进行调整）。 （三）人工成本的预测 人工成本的预测是对行业人工成本指标未来变动趋势进行预测，以便企业了解人工成本变动趋势，及时采取应对措施；是根据对人工成本有关指标的分析，对人工成本水平偏高、人工成本投入产出效益偏低的企业进行提示或预警，指导企业加强人工成本管理。人工成本预测的表现形式可为趋势曲线图。主要预测方法有：回归预测法、趋势预测法和调研预测法。 五、人工成本信息的发布和反馈 省、自治区、直辖市和中心城市应在每年6月底前发布上一年当地行业人工成本信息。发布采用文件、资料等形式。有条件的城市，要通过劳动力市场信息网络发布，供企业、劳动者和其他需求者查询。各级劳动保障部门要在人工成本发布后，利用多种渠道收集市场、企业和劳动者等各方面的反映，不断完善行业人工成本信息指导制度。 发布内容包括人工成本总额、人均人工成本水平指标、企业人工成本占总成本比重指标、企业人工成本结构指标、人工成本投入产出指标、人工成本变动趋势及对人工成本水平偏高和过高的企业进行提示和预警等信息。各地可根据需要增加发布的指标。 人力资源和社会保障咨询服务热线：12333 传真（fax）：0436-3209600 站点导航 地址：白城市中兴东大路2-21号 主办单位：白城市人力资源和社会保障局

              "content": "基于国际知名出版商(Elsevier, Springer, Taylor & Francis, Wiley-Blackwell, NPG)和国际主要OA期刊社(BMC, PLoS, Hindawi, MDPI)的OA论文处理费(APC, Article Processing Charge)调查，我们发现2015年度完全OA期刊的APC主要分布在1000~5000美元之间，混合型(订阅+OA)期刊的APC相对较高，大多为3000美元左右。 近年来，OA出版的快速发展在一定程度上也受到研究(资助)机构相关政策的促进。截至2016年9月，ROARMAP (开放获取资源库强制归档政策注册中心)已列出了全世界781个基金资助机构、研究机构陆续发布的强制性开放获取政策(Open Access Mandate)，要求由公共基金资助的科研成果必须通过各种方式进行开放获取。在学术界、基金资助机构以及出版商的合力推动下，开放获取出版已经从原订阅型期刊出版社的边缘业务转变为主流业务之一，并涌现出大量纯网络版的OA期刊(社)。并且，相当多的OA期刊有较好的学术质量和影响力(目前被SCI收录OA期刊已超过900种)。有研究预计，到2021年，各类开放出版论文将占全部论文的50%左右，到2025年将达到90%。 OA出版需要成本，支付APC来开放传播学术论文符合网络时代的经济规律。由于OA出版是将收入来源由传统的出版后用户征订转为出版前的作者支付,出版机构的收入多少直接取决于OA论文的发表数量，因此，出现了一些为收取APC而有意降低同行评议质量的期刊，有些OA期刊的同行评议甚至流于形式。近年来，有关如何建立合理APC价格机制、如何准确甄别掠夺性期刊已成为国际学术界热议的话题。相信这些OA发展中的问题会随着OA出版体制机制的完善逐步得到解决。 附：国外OA学术期刊APC收取情况（相关数据的采集时间为2016年2月11-15日） Elsevier：ScienceDirect网络出版平台上共有期刊3205种，其中2673种期刊支持开放获取，占83.4%。2673种OA期刊中有完全OA期刊515种，混合OA期刊2158种。515种完全OA期刊中有331种（占64.5%）不收取作者任何费用（费用由期刊主办单位等支付）；另有184种收取APC，金额从100美元到5000美元不等，平均APC为1686美元。收取APC最高（5000美元）的1种期刊为The Lancet Global Health。2158种混合OA期刊中有2155种收费，另有3种APC列表“价格”栏标注为0，并注释“不向作者收取费用”。收取APC最高（5000美元）的22种期刊中包括7种Cell系列期刊和9种The Lancet系列期刊。 Springer：SpringerLink网络出版平台上共有期刊3149种，其中有完全OA期刊（SpringerOpen）233种，混合OA期刊（Open Choice）超过1600种。混合OA期刊的APC统一为3000美元，完全OA期刊的APC因刊而异。曾为SpringerOpen的旗舰期刊SpringerPlus的APC标准为每篇1290美元，该刊宣布从2016年6月起不再接受新投稿（即将停刊）。对研究机构加入了SpringerOpen和BioMed Central的会员项目（Membership Program）的作者和来自欠发达国家的作者均有减免APC的政策，但仅限于完全OA期刊，不包括混合OA期刊。 Taylor & Francis：Taylor & Francis Online上共有期刊2675种，其中，有完全OA期刊72种，混合OA期刊2215种，另有169种期刊在出版后12个月或18个月后允许作者提交社交网站或机构知识库中开放获取。完全OA期刊的APC标准因刊而异。2215种混合OA期刊的APC价格分两种，2950美元（2102种期刊）和1200美元（80种期刊）。 Wiley-Blackwell：Wiley Online Library上共有期刊2372种，其中，有完全OA期刊58种，混合OA期刊约1300种。完全OA期刊的APC范围为800~4500美元，有一些新创办的完全OA期刊不收费；大多数混合OA期刊的APC标准为3000美元。 NPG (Nature Publishing Group): NPG共出版期刊133种，其中81种为OA期刊，占60.9%。81种OA期刊中有完全OA期刊41种，混合OA期刊40种。41种完全OA期刊全部收取APC，金额从1350美元到5200美元不等，平均APC为3580美元。Scientific Data和Scientific Reports的APC远低于同类期刊，分别为1350美元和1495美元。收取APC最高的期刊为Nature Communications（5200美元）。40种混合OA期刊中收取APC平均为3586美元，浮动范围较小，在3200~4400美元之间。 BMC (BioMed Central): 创立于1999年，创立之初是一家独立的出版机构，总部设在英国伦敦，被认为是全球第一个纯网络版期刊开放获取出版商。2008年10月被Springer集团收购。截至2016年2月11日BMC共出版完全OA期刊306种，其中有23种不收取作者任何费用；另有283种收取APC，金额从735美元到2975美元不等，平均APC为2185美元。收取APC最高的1种期刊为Genome Biology（2975美元）。 PLoS (The Public Library of Science): 总部设在美国旧金山，是非营利性出版机构，一直致力于生命科学和医学相关领域纯网络版学术期刊的开放获取出版，是目前国际上致力于开放获取出版最具代表性且已经在学术界取得广泛影响的出版机构之一。从2003年开始相继成功创办了8种开放获取期刊，其中的7种收取APC。PLoS Biology和PLoS Medicine每篇收取2900美元；PLoS ComputationalBiology、PLoS Genetics、PLoS Pathogens、PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases每篇收取2250美元；PLoS ONE从2015年开始收取每篇1495美元，比上年增长了145美元。 MDPI: 成立于1996年，总部设在瑞士巴塞尔。MDPI全称为Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute（多学科数字出版机构）。2008年和2013年分别在中国北京和武汉设立了代表处。截至2016年4月16日MDPI共出版完全OA期刊158种，其中收取APC的期刊为84种，不收取APC的期刊为74种。对创办一段时间还未被SCI收录但被EI、PubMed、Inspec收录的期刊收取少量APC并收取编辑修改费（250瑞士法郎）；创办5年以内的期刊收取少量编辑修改费；最新创办的少数期刊完全免费。 Hindawi: 创建于1997年，公司注册地为美国，实际平台的运维地点设在埃及。截至2016年2月11日Hindawi共出版完全OA期刊405种，其中有5种不收取作者任何费用；另有400种收取APC，金额从400美元到2250美元不等，平均APC为792美元。 本文来自任胜利科学网博客已获作者许可",

              "content": "开放获取（Open Access，简称OA）期刊目前有两个主要的收录平台，DOAJ（Directory of Open Access Journals）和GoOA。并非所有的OA期刊都是WOS（Web of Science）平台收录的SCI（Science Citation Index）期刊。事实上，只有少部分OA期刊是SCI期刊。很多SCI期刊向论文作者提供混合出版模式，即作者可以选择免除出版费用的传统订阅式期刊出版模式，也可以选择支付论文处理费（Article Processing Charge，简称APC）的开放获取期刊出版模式。 DOAJ数据库仅收录纯OA期刊，不收录混合出版模式期刊。因此，在DOAJ中查不到SCI混合出版模式期刊的论文处理费。 APCheck是中国科学院文献情报中心推出的GoOA数据库中查阅SCI-OA期刊论文处理费的在线工具。但是，APCheck无法查阅非SCI的OA期刊的论文处理费。 下表列出这两个数据库适用于不同出版类型的OA期刊的APC查询能力。 本文简述使用DOAJ和GoOA的APCheck查询论文处理费的方法。 一、使用DOAJ查询纯OA期刊的论文处理费 DOAJ是国际上最著名的具有代表性的开放获取期刊收录平台之一，由瑞典德隆大学图书馆于2003年创建，目前收录的期刊数量高达16708种。 打开DOAJ平台网址，在下图所示的期刊（Journals）名称搜索框中打入想要查询的期刊的英文名称，然后点击“SEARCH”键。系统将列出相关期刊及其APC。APC以美元（USD）数额表示或标记为免费（No charges）。 上图中显示的“DOAJ Seal”标志表示DOAJ数据库颁发给在开放获取实践中具有规范表现的期刊的一种荣誉印章。DOAJ数据库中大约有10%的期刊能够获得这种荣誉。DOAJ Seal的评选标准基于以下七个方面。 - 数字式保存。期刊内容必须持续保存在以下数据库之一：在“Keepers Registry”中注册的数据库；互联网数据库；PubMed Central（简称PMC，美国国立卫生研究院的国家医学图书馆的关于生物医学和生命科学的免费期刊文献全文档案）。 - 持续使用文章标识符。所有文章必须持续使用文章标识符，包括DOI、ARK或Handle，而且文章的网页链接必须正确有效。 - 期刊必须向DOAJ数据库提供元数据（metadata）。文章的元数据必须定期上传到DOAJ。 - 开放获取知识共享协议类型。期刊必须采用以下协议中的一种，以方便创作衍生作品：CC BY, CC BY-SA，CC BY-NC，CC BY-NC-SA。 - 文章中的知识共享协议的标注方式。必须以全文文章格式（full-text article format）显示。 - 版权要求。在期刊发表论文时，作者必须保留不受限制的版权。 - 作者自存档政策。期刊必须允许作者自由在线存放并公开论文的各阶段版本，包括预印本、期刊接受发表的手稿、期刊最终发表的定稿等。期刊不准对论文设置禁止开放获取的禁用期。 二、使用GoOA平台的APCheck查询SCI纯OA期刊和SCI混合出版模式期刊的论文处理费 GoOA是中国科学院文献情报中心创建的开放获取期刊收录平台，于2015年发布。GoOA收录的期刊数量比DOAJ少很多，但在质量遴选上更加严格。GoOA数据库的选刊原则包括：被SCI、EI、ISTP等著名数据库收录；具有一定的JCR期刊影响因子和Google Scholar的H5指数；论文经过同行评议审查；不在Beall期刊和出版商黑名单和可疑名单中。GoOA每年发布《OA期刊年度排行榜报告》，帮助作者在投稿时选刊。 点击GoOA网站的“APC合理性查询”APCheck网页，在期刊名称搜索栏中输入期刊名称，然后点击“期刊APC合理性查询”，会得到以下结果。APCheck也有手机版，可经微信关注GoOA头条，然后访问栏目“APCheck”。 上图左侧展示APC合理性分析。这个查询例子使用的是《Friction》期刊，它不收论文处理费。另外，如果将鼠标放在图中某个圆点上，屏幕上就能显示该期刊的名字，例如上图中所示的“Journal of Engineering Mechanics”。 关于上图左侧横轴显示的OA期刊影响力，这一指标在文献计量学中并不是一个众所周知或具有明确定义的计量指标，而APCheck也没有给出它的具体计算方法。其中提到的H5指数是指期刊在过去5年中发表论文的H指数，是谷歌学术在H指数基础上推出的期刊学术影响力评价指标。 上图左侧显示的2万元人民币红线源于2020年2月中国科技部印发的《关于破除科技评价中“唯论文”不良导向的若干措施（试行）》的通知。该通知对论文发表费用给予严格规定：“对于单篇论文发表支出超过2万元人民币的，需经论文通讯作者或第一作者所在单位学术委员会对论文发表的必要性审核通过后，方可在国家科技计划项目专项资金中列支。”通知还规定：“对于发表在黑名单和预警名单学术期刊上的论文，相关的论文发表支出不得在国家科技计划项目专项资金中列支。” 上图右侧提到的“被WOS收录”是指被Web of Science平台收录。WOS的一个重要数据库就是SCI（实指SCIE，即Science Citation Index Expanded）。 相比于DOAJ，GoOA的APCheck工具能够方便地查阅SCI-OA期刊的论文处理费，包括纯OA期刊和混合出版模式期刊，并能查看期刊的APC折扣政策和与类似期刊的发表费用比较。 需要英文润色，英语润色，就找Wordvice。 | 资源博客 | 学术论文润色 | 学术论文翻译 | 期刊论文润色 | 毕业论文润色 | 论文摘要润色 | 服务费用 | FAQ |",
